###DOM4 Elements

DOM4 Elements (GitHub: [barberboy / dom4-elements](https://github.com/barberboy/dom4-elements), License: _MIT_) by Ben Barber is a polyfill for `document.query` and `document.queryAll`, from the [DOM  Level 4 ParentNode interface](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-parentnode).

Using `document.queryAll` returns a new class called `Elements`, which extends `Array.prototype` so you can do things like `document.queryAll('.classname').map(fn)`.

Browser support is [documented by Testling](https://ci.testling.com/barberboy/dom4-elements), and the project includes a [small test suite](https://github.com/barberboy/dom4-elements/blob/master/test/index.js).

###ng-Fx

[ng-Fx](http://hendrixer.github.io/) (GitHub: [Hendrixer/ng-Fx](https://github.com/Hendrixer/ng-Fx), License: _MIT_) by Scott Moss is an AngularJS version of [Animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).

You can use classes to apply effects, then directives to control their behaviour:

{% highlight javascript %}
<ul ng-init="foods=['apple', 'chips', 'muffin']">
  <li class='fx-fade-down fx-easing-bounce' ng-repeat="food in foods">
    {{ food }}
  </li>
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

Some options are controlled by classes where I expected to see directives -- I think the author has tried to use CSS as much as possible rather than using JavaScript to write out `style` tags to do the necessary styling.  For example: `fx-speed-800` compared to `ng-fx-speed="800"`.  A hypothetical `ng-fx-speed` could accept any speed rather than predefined ones.
