###Lithium Labs Visualization Components

![Sentiment Wave](/images/posts/sentimentwave.png)

Recently I've been looking for D3 libraries, and coincidentally Jack Herrington sent in Lithium Labs Visualization Components (GitHub: [lithiumtech / li-visualizations](https://github.com/lithiumtech/li-visualizations), License: _Apache 2.0_, Bower: _li-visualizations_).  This is a set of D3 visualisations, including Sentiment Wave, Reticule, and Elegant Waves.

It includes some examples written in CoffeeScript and an example application that you can try out locally with preloaded data.

###The Zen Approach

[The Zen Approach](https://github.com/Nijikokun/the-zen-approach) by Nijikokun is a JavaScript style guide.  It's detailed and instructive, so it may work well as a beginner's guide if you're looking for documentation that will get existing programmers up to speed with modern JavaScript.

> #### Multiline
> Judgement call, the slowest known method is `[].join`. If you are building something that requires high performance __do not__ use `[].join`. It's not bad, it's just not performant.
> The two fastest methods of multiline are one-line strings (no breaks), and in second using the `\` character (breaks), with `+` (concat) trailing slightly behind. [I'll let hard data back me up on this.](http://jsperf.com/ya-string-concat/10)
> My personal preference is to use one line for performance (word-wrap exists people), and then `[].join` for non-performant things, like variables and such. Should the line require variables _and_ need to be performant I will use `+` concat notation.

The author hints that it may become a book, series of talks, or an open source handout -- it's currently MIT licensed.
