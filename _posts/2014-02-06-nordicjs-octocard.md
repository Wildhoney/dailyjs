###Nordic.js

![Nordic.js](/images/posts/nordicjs.png)

[Nordic.js](http://nordicjs.com/) is a two day conference that takes place in Stockholm in September.  They're [accepting proposals for talks](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SeREqrU7Icqp-EQ1jKzxm214MUjeP3ORXmXv0OB12HM/viewform), so you might want to bookmark that link if you're interested in speaking.

Tickets aren't yet available, but apparently a related meetup in Stockholm is extremely popular, so it'll sell out quickly.

###Octocard

[Octocard](http://octocard.info/) (GitHub: [zmmbreeze / octocard](https://github.com/zmmbreeze/octocard), License: _MIT_) is a GitHub widget, with a nice, compact design and a cool graph.

It's used by including a `<script>` element with data attributes, and you can [theme it fairly easily](https://github.com/zmmbreeze/octocard#how-to-customize-theme).

There's also a Node project called [octocard-server](https://github.com/zmmbreeze/octocard-server) that can serve data from MongoDB.  It uses GitHub authentication, and the [octonode](https://npmjs.org/package/octonode) GitHub API wrapper.
