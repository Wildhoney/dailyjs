Hugh Kennedy sent in [npm-install](https://atom.io/packages/npm-install), an Atom package for automatically installing and saving the npm modules in the current file.

To use it, you just need to open the Command Palette and type `npm install`.  The Command Palette can be opened with `cmd-shift-p`.

There's another npm-related Atom package as well: [npm-docs](https://atom.io/packages/npm-docs) by Jonathan Clem.  This allows you to use the Command Palette to easily look up a module's readme or homepage.  This is the kind of thing I do all the time when I write about Node on DailyJS.

[Tyler Benziger](https://twitter.com/tybenz) kindly sent me the Atom invitation, but I've only used it for a few small things so far.  I've been trying to figure out how it fits in with the Node community, and whether or not it'll be popular with DailyJS readers.

If you look at the screenshot in this post you might notice that I've got a folder open with lots of items.  That's DailyJS's 1127 posts, which Atom handles without any trouble.
