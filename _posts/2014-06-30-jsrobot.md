My digital residual self image isn't what it once was, but surely I'm more than a smiling face glyph!  [JS Robot](http://jsrobot.tk/) by Pavel Evsegneev an open source game for learning JavaScript.  The GitHub repository is here: [Ahineya / jsrobot](https://github.com/Ahineya/jsrobot).

The levels are unit tested with Mocha, and the author accepts pull requests for new levels.  Levels are defined as text files, like this:

{% highlight text %}
########
#_  $f #
########
{% endhighlight %}

The `_` is the start position, `$` and `#` are walls, and `f` is the finish.  The player must write JavaScript that pushes the robot to the `f` position.  The full list of symbols is defined in [map.js](https://github.com/Ahineya/jsrobot/blob/master/js/map.js):

{% highlight javascript %}
var SYMBOL_TYPES = {
  '#': 'wall',
  '$': 'wall',
  'space': 'space',
  '_': 'start',
  'f': 'finish'
};
{% endhighlight %}

It's a fun game that may have a few surprises for beginners learning JavaScript, and the code is clean.  You could easily extend it to have fancier graphics or a different narrative, but I like the text-based interface.  It would be nice to optionally play it in a terminal by installing it with npm.
