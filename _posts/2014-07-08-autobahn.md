[Autobahn|JS](http://autobahn.ws/js/) (GitHub: [tavendo / AutobahnJS](https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnJS/), License: _MIT_, npm: [autobahn](https://www.npmjs.org/package/autobahn)) is an implementation of a protocol that supports RPC and PubSub that runs over WebSocket, with fallbacks for older browsers.

The PubSub model supports topics, and uses a promise-based API:

{% highlight javascript %}
// Subscribe to a topic
session.subscribe('com.myapp.topic1', onEvent).then(
  function(subscription) {
    console.log('Subscribed:', subscription);
    currentSubscription = subscription;
  },

  function(error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
);
{% endhighlight %}

The support for RPC is based on a router, where routes are represented as strings.  Registering a remote procedure also uses a promise:

{% highlight javascript %}
// Define the remote procedure
function utcnow() {
  var now = new Date();
  return now.toISOString();
}

// Register the remote procedure with the router
session.register('com.timeservice.now', utcnow).then(
  function(registration) {
    console.log('Procedure registered:', registration.id);
  },
  function(error) {
    console.error('Registration failed:', error);
  }
);
{% endhighlight %}

You can call this remote procedure with `session.call('com.timeservice.now')`, which again returns a promise.

To use Autobahn, you also need an application router.  The documentation mentions [Crossbar.io](http://crossbar.io/).  This allows you to create distributed server applications, so you could route between backends running on different platforms.  [Authorization is supported](https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar/wiki/Authorization), so you can limit access to server-side resources.

The project is based on an open protocol called [WAMP](http://wamp.ws/) (Web Application Messaging Protocol).  Other WAMP implementations include [Autobahn|Android](http://autobahn.ws/android/) and [wampy.js](https://github.com/KSDaemon/wampy.js).
