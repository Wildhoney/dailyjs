Archive.org has a section dedicated to software.  Inside you'll find [The Internet Archive Console Living Room](https://archive.org/details/consolelivingroom), which has details on some major games consoles from the late 70s and 1980s, including the [Atari 2600](https://archive.org/details/atari_2600_library) and the [ColecoVision](https://archive.org/details/coleco_colecovision_library).

The great thing about this project is they're trying to keep old software alive.  You can browse through titles and play them in a browser.  This is powered by [jsmess](http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Javascript_Mess) (GitHub: [jsmess / jsmess](https://github.com/jsmess/jsmess)), an Emscripten-based emulator derived from [MESS](http://www.mess.org/):

> The JAVASCRIPT MESS project is a porting of the MESS emulator, a program that emulates hundreds of machine types, into the JavaScript language. The MESS program can emulate (or begin to emulate) a majority of home computers, and continues to be improved frequently. By porting this program into the standardized and cross-platform JavaScript language, it will be possible to turn computer history and experience into the same embeddable object as movies, documents, and audio.

Running a game binary requires a suitable BIOS, but the groundwork for lots of systems has been added to MESS:

> MESS and MAME were started over a decade ago to provide ubiquitous, universal emulation of arcade/gaming machines (MAME) and general computer hardware (MESS). While specific emulation implementations exist that do specific machines better than MAME/MESS, no other project has the comprehensiveness and modularity. Modifications are consistently coming in, and emulation breadth and quality increases over time. In the case of MAME, pages exist listing machines it does not emulate.

Over the last two years there's been a flood of new browser-based emulators, supporting everything from [the Amiga](http://scriptedamigaemulator.net/readme.htm) to the [Game Boy Advance](https://github.com/jpfau/gbajs).  Part of what makes these project possible is recent technologies like Canvas, WebGL, WebAudio, and FileReader.  But even seemingly less buzzwordy APIs like typed arrays can help get old games running smoothly.
