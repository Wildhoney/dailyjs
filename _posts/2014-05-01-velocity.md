Julian Shapiro sent in [Velocity.js](http://julian.com/research/velocity/) (GitHub: [julianshapiro / velocity](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity), License: _MIT_), a performance-focused animation library that is an alternative to jQuery's `$.animate` method.  If you're struggling with CSS animations and would prefer to use JavaScript, then Velocity may help.  Judging by the project's [Playground teaser](http://julian.com/research/velocity/playground.html), it seems like it's more ambitious than just supporting basic animations, however.

Basic animation works as you'd expect if you've used `$.animate`:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('div').velocity({ top: 50 });
{% endhighlight %}

You can supply additional arguments:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('div').velocity({ opacity: 1 }, { duration: 1000 });
{% endhighlight %}

Easing and queues are also supported:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('div').velocity({
  borderBottomWidth: ['2px', 'spring' ],
  width: '100px',
  height: '100px'
}, {
  easing: 'easeInSine'
});
{% endhighlight %}

[The documentation](http://julian.com/research/velocity/) has more examples.  The source has some useful comments about how the project works, and why it's fast:

> JavaScript and jQuery are falsely conflated. JavaScript animation, which Velocity uses, is fast; it's jQuery that's slow. Although Velocity is a jQuery plugin, it uses its own animation stack that delivers its performance through two underlying design principles: 1) synchronize the DOM â†’ tween stack to minimize layout thrashing, and 2) cache values to minimize the occurrence of DOM querying.

There's also a post about [Velocity on the David Walsh Blog](http://davidwalsh.name/css-js-animation), and the author is promising more features and tests by May 5th.
