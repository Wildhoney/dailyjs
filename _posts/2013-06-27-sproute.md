Application development on the web is not easy. You need to understand server-side languages, databases, performance, security... the list goes on. It can take months to develop even simple applications. [**Sproute**](http://sproute.io) is a new kind of web framework that allows you to create apps in minutes.

In this tutorial we will be creating a mini-Twitter clone complete with a feed, login/register and profile page. It shall be called "Critter".

*Sproute is currently available on a commercial license to fund further development. Use the discount code [**dailyjs**](http://gum.co/sproute/dailyjs) to get it free or contact us at contact@sproute.io.*

The structure of a Sproute app is as follows:

* [Views](http://sproute.io/docs/views): HTML pages with embedded template tags to request and display data.
* [Models](http://sproute.io/docs/model): JSON object to define what the data looks like.
* [Controller](http://sproute.io/docs/controller): A mapping from URLs to Views using routes.

###Setup

After installation you will need to edit [`config.json`](http://sproute.io/docs/config). Add a `name` property:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "name": "critter"
}
{% endhighlight %}

This will create a Mongo database called `critter`.

###The Feed

This will be a view that lists the micro-blog posts by a user. Create a view under the `views/` directory called `feed.sprt`. *`.sprt` is the default extension for views, you may change this in the [`config.json`](http://sproute.io/docs/config#extension) file.*

To get the data from the Mongo database, we need to use the template language; in particular the tag `get`. All data is read, updated, created and deleted through an HTTP interface prefixed with `/data/` so we must construct a URL to get the post data.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/alexyoung/f90a95fc39bd3e6f00a4.js?file=template1"> </script>

This will retrieve every row in the `posts` collection. Generally we want a feed of a particular user so we need to filter the results by `username`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/alexyoung/f90a95fc39bd3e6f00a4.js?file=template2"> </script>

A few things to explain here. First of all the two parts to the URL will filter the results where the field name equals the value. 

Secondly `_creatorName` is an [in-built field](http://sproute.io/docs/database#in-built-fields) so whenever a row is created, Sproute will automatically add some metadata about the row; in this case the username who created the post. 

Lastly, `params.user` is a placeholder from a route in the controller that points to this view.

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "/:user": "feed"
}
{% endhighlight %}

This route means anything requested after `/` will render the view `feed.sprt` and put the value in the `params` object under the key `user`. Let's use an example:

{% highlight text %}
GET http://example.com/louisstow
params.user == "louisstow"
{% endhighlight %}

So now that we have all the post data under a given user, we need to render it by looping over each post. We do this with the template tag `each` and some HTML.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/alexyoung/f90a95fc39bd3e6f00a4.js?file=template3"> </script>

Before we run this, we're missing one little piece. We're requesting data from a collection called `posts` which doesn't currently exist. We need to define it as a model to ensure some data integrity.

Models are defined as JSON files under the `models/` directory. Create a file called `posts.json`. Sproute will create a collection for each model using the filename. Inside the model, we should define the field we will be using.

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "content": {"type": "String"}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Yep, that's it. The model tells Sproute that the `posts` collection has a `content` field of type `string` (text). Everything else we use is an in-built field. You can add some more constraints in here such as minimum and maximum length. Maybe we could limit it to 140 characters ;).

###Posting a Micro-Blog

Now that we can display the data, let's make sure we can create it via some HTML in `feed.sprt`:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/alexyoung/f90a95fc39bd3e6f00a4.js?file=template4"> </script>

Plain old HTML is enough to insert data in Sproute by setting the action to the HTTP interface and the method to `post`. 

Notice the query variable `goto`. It's a nice feature that will redirect the user after doing the action, you will see it used in a few other end-points throughout the project. We also use `self.url` to get the current page to redirect to.

###User Accounts

Sproute has [user accounts](http://sproute.io/docs/users) built in. You just have to create the front-end including the login and register page. Create two views, `login.sprt` and `register.sprt`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/alexyoung/f90a95fc39bd3e6f00a4.js?file=template5"> </script>

Send a POST request to `/api/login` with the username and password to create a session and log that user in.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/alexyoung/f90a95fc39bd3e6f00a4.js?file=template6"> </script>

Send a POST request to `/api/register` with the desired username, password and any other values you want stored with the user to create a new user row. This does not log them in.

Logging the user out is as simple as visiting `/api/logout`.

We can restrict HTML from rendering in our views if the user is not logged in. The form to post a micro-blog should only appear for users who are logged in:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/alexyoung/f90a95fc39bd3e6f00a4.js?file=template7"> </script>

###The Home Page

Our controller doesn't handle the index or home page. Add another route before the feed and create a view called `home.sprt`.

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "/": "home",
  "/:user": "feed"
}
{% endhighlight %}

What to put on the home page? This is up to you, maybe a bit of a splash page to introduce the reader to your new micro-blog. Maybe we want to show off some of the users.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/alexyoung/f90a95fc39bd3e6f00a4.js?file=template8"> </script>

###Secure It

After creating a fully functioning micro-blog, the next step is to lock it down. Right now anyone can create a post whether or not they are logged in. There is a nice feature in Sproute where  you can specify a route (just like the controller) and who can access it. It's defined in [`permissions.json`](http://sproute.io/docs/permissions).

Let's evaluate our product and decide what we need to secure. We don't want just anybody creating a post, we want them at least to be members, so let's add that restriction:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "POST /data/posts": "member"
}
{% endhighlight %}

`member` is a default [user type](http://sproute.io/docs/permissions). You can create your own user types by overriding the in-built `users` model. There are also special user types:

* `owner`: Give access to the logged in user where the `_creator` field matches their user ID.
* `stranger`: Give access to a user who is **not** logged in.
* `anyone`: No restriction.

For anyone to create a post, they must be logged in. We also need to make sure not just anybody can delete or edit the posts.

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "POST /data/posts": "member",
  "DELETE /data/posts": "admin",
  "DELETE /data/posts/*": "owner",
  "POST /data/posts/*": "owner"
}
{% endhighlight %}

An entire collection can be wiped by sending a DELETE request to  `/data/<collection>` so add a restriction that only `admin` accounts can do that.

Let the creators be able to remove their own posts through `DELETE /data/posts/*`. Similarly let them edit their own posts.
