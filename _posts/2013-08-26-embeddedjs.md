Most of us started out writing JavaScript for web pages.  Even if you're a server-side developer focused on Node, you probably wrote client-side JavaScript first.  We see JavaScript as a language closely integrated with the DOM, and as a relatively lightweight server-side language, but you can flip this around and think of it as en entirely embedded language: after all, it's embedded within web pages -- it's bridged to native data structures and functionalities that are required by the runtime.

###Why Embed?

Why are scripting languages embedded in other software at all?  If you think about a large C++, C#, or Objective-C project, then build time and deployment are major issues.  Certain programming chores lend themselves well to scripting languages, so rather than rebuilding a huge project every time a small tweak is required, changing a script might be more productive.

In game development Python and Lua are typical choices for scripting.  They're used for game interfaces, logic, asset loading, AI, and more.  Part of the success of the modding community based around Unreal engine games came from the use of [UnrealScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnrealScript).

###Binding

You're probably wondering: why Python and Lua?  It's mainly because these languages are widely adopted and suitable for embedding.  [Boost.Python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/python/doc/index.html) and [Luabind](http://www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind.html) are examples of libraries that help with binding.  Without bindings to the underlying native code it's impossible for the scripting language to communicate, so this has to be fast and easy.

###Web UI

An alternative to low-level binding is to use a web view that hosts JavaScript code, with some event-based bindings to the underlying application.  Many mobile and desktop applications use web views for chunks of UI that are easier to implement with HTML, so this is happening more often than you might realise.

Once you've got large amounts of UI written with HTML, the required JavaScript starts to become messy.  That's where modern MVC frameworks like Backbone and AngularJS come in: but writing this code properly is a whole skill in itself, so that's when the C++/Objective-C developers call us for help!

Unfortunately, embedding JavaScript as a runtime isn't simple as it should be.  There are many different ways to do it for each language.

###.NET

In the .NET world there are lots of projects for running JavaScript inside your applications.  [IronJS](https://github.com/fholm/IronJS) is an ECMAScript 3.0 implementation built on Microsoft's [Dynamic Language Runtime](http://dlr.codeplex.com/).  [ClearScript](http://clearscript.codeplex.com/) allows multiple scripting languages to be added to .NET applications: it supports JavaScript through V8 -- imagine being able to add `using Microsoft.ClearScript.V8` to a C# program and then do `engine.Execute("Console.WriteLine(lib.System.DateTime.Now)")`.  There's also [Jurassic](http://jurassic.codeplex.com/) -- another ECMAScript runtime.

###C++

The general wisdom seems to be that [embedding V8 is the way to go](https://developers.google.com/v8/embed).  There are also SpiderMonkey-based projects like [libjspp](https://code.google.com/p/libjspp/).

###Objective-C

Apple's [Introduction to WebKit Objective-C Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/DisplayWebContent/DisplayWebContent.html) explains how to access JavaScript from Objective-C.

Another approach is to embed [JavaScriptCore](http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore).  Apparently, [Appcelerator Titanium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appcelerator_Titanium) uses JavaScriptCore for iOS projects -- you should be able to figure this out by looking at [Appcelerator's GitHub projects](https://github.com/appcelerator/).

###Job Opportunities

I'm currently contracting at a particularly eclectic office: my team has Objective-C, C++, C#, and JavaScript developers.  The shared wisdom amongst the non-JavaScript developers is they want to embed JavaScript in their projects: whether they're games, desktop software, or mobile applications.

That's great for us, but it's worth remembering that JavaScript isn't good at _everything_ -- the type system might not suit certain projects, its scope and coercion rules can be a source of frustration for people from other backgrounds.  It looks C-like, but that doesn't mean it's C: and that's the problem when you're working with people who are more fluent in C than JavaScript.

If you're wondering how people see JavaScript from the other side, then I found [Choosing a scripting language](http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/01/Choosing-a-scripting-language) by David Rosen interesting: he struggled with JavaScript's readability because he couldn't overload operators, and wanted to write maintainable linear algebra code.

However, it seems like there's a huge amount of momentum behind JavaScript in a growing number of platforms, so it's an area you should take seriously.  Don't be surprised to find yourself writing scripts for games or apps in the near future.
