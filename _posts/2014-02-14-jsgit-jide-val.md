###JS-Git Progress

Khalid Khan sent in an email to say that Tim Caswell [JS-Git](https://github.com/creationix/js-git) project is seeing a lot of [activity recently](https://github.com/creationix/js-git/commits/master).
It seems like this new branch has changed a lot compared to the [old branch](https://github.com/creationix/js-git/tree/legacy#related-packages).

I'd file this under "Captain's Log: Supplemental", but let's see what happens over the next few weeks.  If you're interested in this project, it might be a good time to [start following Tim on Twitter](https://twitter.com/creationix).

###jide.js

Patrick Gotthardt recently wrote two articles about [jide.js](http://js.jidesoft.com/).  One includes [jide.js benchmarks](http://www.pagosoft.com/javascript/what-about-jide-js-performance/):

> Since the next release of jide.js is supposed to introduce massive performance improvements, I thought it might be a good idea to see how it holds up against this benchmark. I used a modified version from vue.js which seems to include a few more nice frameworks.

There's also a nicely presented [introduction to jide.js](http://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-jide-js/):

> jide.js is a new toolkit for creating modern web applications. It consists of a collection of useful controls and all the tools you need to create your own, application specific, components. jide.js fully embraces AMD (require.js) to allow you to pick only those parts of it that you truly need. Starting with version 1.0.0-beta3, youâ€™ll also be able to use it with Browserify.

> At its core, jide.js is built around observable values, event emitters, and data binding. It utilizes the features of modern browsers (IE9+) to create a solid cross platform experience and to leverage the features of the current JavaScript language instead of clinging to the past.

###Val

Mark Steve Samson has created [a Valentine card generator](http://marksteve.com/val/) (GitHub: [marksteve / val](https://github.com/marksteve/val), License: _MIT_).  If you've been desperately searching for a `tweenHeart` function, then you're in luck!
