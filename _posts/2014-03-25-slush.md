If you've been won over by [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), the streaming build system, then you've probably been wondering about scaffolding.

[Slush](http://klei.github.io/slush/) (GitHub: [klei / slush](https://github.com/klei/slush), npm: [slush](https://www.npmjs.org/package/slush)) takes Gulp's streaming build concept and applies it to scaffolds, making it a Gulp-friendly Yeoman competitor.

The author, Joakim Bengtson, notes that it may take a while for the registry of available generators to update, so until then you can use [the slushgenerator tag on npm](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/slushgenerator).

Slush itself is fairly simple -- it's basically an interface for finding and installing generators.  Like Gulp, it's based on [liftoff](https://www.npmjs.org/package/liftoff), the command-line tool authoring module.
