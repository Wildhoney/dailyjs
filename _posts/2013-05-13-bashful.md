On a philosophical level, [Node developers love Unix](http://blog.izs.me/post/48281998870/unix-philosophy-and-node-js).  I like to think that's why Node's core modules are relatively lightweight compared to other standard libraries (is an [FTP library](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/net/ftp/rdoc/index.html) really necessary?) -- Node's modules quietly get out of the way, allowing the community to provide solutions to higher-level problems.

As someone who sits inside tmux/Vim/ssh all day, I'm preoccupied with command-line tools and ways to work more efficiently in the shell.  That's why I was intrigued to find bashful (GitHub: [substack / bashful](https://github.com/substack/bashful), License: _MIT_, npm: [bashful](https://npmjs.org/package/bashful)) by substack.  It allows Bash to be parsed and executed.  To use it, hook it up with some streams:

{% highlight javascript %}
var bash = require('bashful')(process.env);
bash.on('command', require('child_process').spawn);

var s = bash.createStream();
process.stdin.pipe(s).pipe(process.stdout);
{% endhighlight %}

After installing `bashful`, running this example with `node sh.js` will allow you to issue shell commands.  Not all of Bash's built-in commands are supported yet (there's a list and to-do in the readme), but you should be able to execute commands and run `true` and `false`, then get the last exit status with `echo $?`.

How does this work?  Well, the bashful module basically parses each line, character-by-character, to tokenise the input.  It then [checks anything that looks like a command](https://github.com/substack/bashful/blob/699cafe4f9e35c9f4c88836866efbcbaab21b894/index.js#L114) against the list of built-in commands, and runs it.  It mixes Node streams with a JavaScript bash parser to create a Bash-like layer that you can reuse with other streams.

This module depends on [shell-quote](https://github.com/substack/node-shell-quote), which correctly escapes those gnarly quotes in shell commands.  I expect substack will make a few more shell-related modules as he continues work on bashful.

[ShellJS](http://documentup.com/arturadib/shelljs) (GitHub: [arturadib / shelljs](https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs), npm: [shelljs](https://npmjs.org/package/shelljs)) by Artur Adib has been around for a while, but still receives regular updates.  This module gives you shell-like commands in Node:

{% highlight javascript %}
require('shelljs/global');

mkdir('-p', 'out/Release');
cp('-R', 'stuff/*', 'out/Release');
{% endhighlight %}

It can even mimic Make, so you could write your build scripts with it.  This would make sense if you're sharing code with Windows-based developers.

There are plenty of other interesting [Unix](https://npmjs.org/browse/keyword/unix)-related modules that are alive and regularly updated.  One I was looking at recently is suppose (GitHub: [jprichardson / node-suppose](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-suppose), License: _MIT_, npm: [suppose](https://npmjs.org/package/suppose)) by JP Richardson, which is an expect(1) clone:

{% highlight javascript %}
var suppose = require('suppose')
  , fs = require('fs')
  , assert = require('assert')

suppose('npm', ['init'])
  .debug(fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/debug.txt'))
  .on(/name\: \([\w|\-]+\)[\s]*/).respond('awesome_package\n')
  .on('version: (0.0.0) ').respond('0.0.1\n')
  // ...
{% endhighlight %}

It uses a chainable API to allow expect-like expressions to capture and react to the output of other programs.

Unix in the Node community is alive and well, but I'm sure there's also lots of [Windows-related fun](https://npmjs.org/browse/keyword/windows) to be had -- assuming you can figure out how to use Windows 9 with a keyboard and mouse that is...
