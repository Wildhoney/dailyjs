Joe Minichino sent in [LokiJS](http://lokijs.org/) (GitHub: [techfort/LokiJS](https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS), License: _BSD_, npm: [lokijs](https://www.npmjs.org/package/lokijs)), an in-memory document database written in JavaScript.  It runs in browsers and Node, and supports JSON persistence.

It uses an auto-generated binary index, which helps keep simple find operations fast.  MongoDB-style `find` queries are naturally slower, but you can create indexes that are stored in-memory.  Also, the authors have adapted it to suit mobile applications -- there are several special cases for Cordova, so it should work well for mobile-first applications.  You can read more about performance in [Indexing and Query Performance](https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS/wiki/Indexing-and-Query-Performance) on the LokiJS wiki.

Other than indexing, there are other advanced features that projects like this usually don't support, including transactions and CouchDB-style views.  Views are functions that can be stored with `collection.storeView`, then accessed with `collection.view`.  There are examples for views, map reduce, and indexing [on the LokiJS wiki](https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS/wiki).

LokiJS is tested with [gordian](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gordian), which is also written by Joe Minichino.  There is a Gulp-based build script, and a demo application that's meant to run on the desktop.
