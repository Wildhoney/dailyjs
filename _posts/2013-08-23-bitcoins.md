Bitcoin might seem like a crazy cryptocurrency, mainly because it is, but it's also becoming more widely adopted.  I find it fascinating because it feels like I'm finally living in a 90s Neal Stephenson or William Gibson novel, although the possibility of making online payments outside of the standard merchant account/bank model has its appeal.

I've been researching the state of bitcoin payments in JavaScript to see how easy it is to set up.  The first thing I found was [CoinWidget](http://coinwidget.com/) -- this allows you to accept donations using client-side JavaScript.  I've added a widget to DailyJS in case you want to donate, but it should be easy enough to add to your own sites as well.

###Address validation

A bitcoin address includes a four byte checksum, which means addresses can be validated without talking to any servers.  The bitcoin-address module (GitHub: [shtylman / bitcoin-address](https://github.com/shtylman/bitcoin-address), npm: [bitcoin-address](https://npmjs.org/package/bitcoin-address)) by Roman Shtylman implements the algorithm: a double SHA-256 digest of the 21 bytes before the checksum is calculated to validate the address.

{% highlight javascript %}
var btcAddr = require('bitcoin-address');
btcAddr.validate('1Gtov23WTQPbj4c6dMaXnXxbvFKc87Lutb');
// true
{% endhighlight %}

Addresses are encoded with base 58, so Roman's module includes his own decoding library.  He also uses Node `Buffer` objects to work with the decoded data.  Node's `crypto` core module is used to create SHA-256 hashes.

###Wallets

If you install a wallet like Bitcoin-QT, you should get `bitcoind` running in the background.  This has an optional JSON API.  There are several npm modules for this API, like: [bitcoin](https://npmjs.org/package/bitcoin).  This allows you to query the daemon for transactions, account balances, and you can even create backups of wallets.  There's a [full API call list](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list) on the [Bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/).

###Accepting payments

There's no easy way to accept payments for web-based transactions, because you really need to talk to a bitcoin wallet to see if a customer's payment has been made.  I've seen people hosting Java-based wallets on Heroku, and wallets usually have APIs that we can talk to from Node, but this isn't exactly ideal.

That's where [bitcoin merchants come in](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merchant_Howto).  They handle all the messy stuff so you can keep your web application code simple.  Popular merchants with sensible APIs include [BIPS](https://bips.me/) and [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/).

This is the [BIPS REST API (PDF)](https://bips.me/connect/BitcoinInternetPaymentSystemAPI.pdf), and [the Coinbase API](https://coinbase.com/docs/api/overview).  There are [Coinbase modules on npm](https://npmjs.org/search?q=coinbase) and a [BIPS API library](https://npmjs.org/package/bips).

###Exchanges

Exchanges, like the infamous [Mt.Gox](https://mtgox.com/), also have APIs.  Through exchanges you can track interesting information about bitcoins, particularly exchange rate values, and some even allow trades to be made.  There's an [Mt.Gox module on npm](https://npmjs.org/package/mtgox-apiv2), which is light on documentation: check out [MtGox/API](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MtGox/API) for a general overview.

If you've written any bitcoin-related Node or client-side projects, send them in!
