[Fluxxor](http://fluxxor.com/) (GitHub: [BinaryMuse / fluxxor](https://github.com/BinaryMuse/fluxxor), License: _MIT_, Bower: _fluxxor_) by Brandon Tilley is a library designed to work with Facebook's [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).  It provides an [application architecture](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html) that's based around a dispatcher, stores, and views.

Instantiating a Flux application looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var flux = new Fluxxor.Flux(stores, actions);
{% endhighlight %}

The `stores` object contains classes that are created with `Fluxxor.createStore`, and the `actions` object is a set of methods that invoke that dispatcher:

{% highlight javascript %}
var actions = {
  addTodo: function(text) {
    this.dispatch("ADD_TODO", {text: text});
  },

  toggleTodo: function(todo) {
    this.dispatch("TOGGLE_TODO", {todo: todo});
  },

  clearTodos: function() {
    this.dispatch("CLEAR_TODOS");
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

These examples were taken from the [Fluxxor quick start guide](http://fluxxor.com/getting-started/quick-start.html), which explains how to write a to-do list with Flux.

Fluxxor provides more tools as well.  [Fluxxor.FluxMixin](http://fluxxor.com/documentation/flux-mixin.html) can be used to make Flux instances available to React components, and [Fluxxor.StoreWatchMixin](http://fluxxor.com/documentation/store-watch-mixin.html) allows you to watch for change events on Flux stores.

You can use Fluxxor outside of React, and it's installable with Bower as `fluxxor`.  Brandon, the author of the library, pointed out that Fluxxor is his personal implementation of the Flux pattern which was created by Jing Chen at Facebook.
