Imagine being able to run `npm install gprs` to add GPRS tracking support to a hardware project... Well, now you can with [Tessel](https://tessel.io/)!

The idea behind hardware platforms like Tessel is to make it easier for software developers to interface with hardware.  This is ideal if you've ever thought it would be nice to hook up a movement sensor to a camera to take a photo whenever your dog or cat moves.

Microcontrollers are chips that contain a processor, memory, and I/O.  You can hook them up to sensors for input, and things like servos and speakers for output.  Unfortunately microcontrollers have limitations -- once you start adding the amount of RAM and processing power required for a high-level language like JavaScript then the costs add up.  Also, while they can be programmed, most of them aren't trivial to program -- some have to be flashed with special hardware.

This is why Arduino was such a big deal: it made it easier for programmers and non-technical tinkerers to upload code to a microcontroller using a computer and USB cable.

Tessel and [Espruino](http://www.espruino.com/) have iterated on Arduino by using slightly more powerful hardware to allow JavaScript to run.  Espruino's strength is it uses a specialised version of JavaScript that means it can use cheaper, low-powered hardware.

On the other hand, Tessel has built-in Wi-Fi and an ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller.  Because it's so powerful, it can run thousands of standard Node modules straight from npm.  And even better, [Tessel has a wide selection of hardware modules](https://tessel.io/modules), including:

* Accelerometer
* Audio (MP3/AAC/WMA/MIDI/FLAC/Ogg Vorbis)
* Bluetooth LE
* Camera
* MicroSD
* Relay (for controlling higher-powered devices)
* Servo

Naturally all of these toys come at a price: Tessel with a single module costs $99.  You can also buy Tessel with all available modules for $599.

I have an Espruino, but I don't have a Tessel yet.  I like the idea of using `npm install` with Tessel, but Espruino is already easy to connect to sensors and other hardware, particularly for those with Arduino experience.

My recommendation is to try Tessel if you're perplexed by hardware but good at Node, and have some free time and cash.
