[Hoodie](http://hood.ie/) (GitHub: [hoodiehq / hoodie.js](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie.js), License: _Apache 2.0_, npm: [hoodie](https://npmjs.org/package/hoodie)) is a [noBackend](http://nobackend.org/) framework that uses Node, with a focus on client-side development.

> noBackend is an approach to decouple apps from backends, by abstracting backend tasks with frontend code. This allows frontend developers to focus on user experience and gives backend developers more flexibility on the implementation side.

Hoodie applications are based around documents, and are backed by CouchDB.  It embraces event-based APIs, JSON across the whole stack, and uses npm for plugins.  It's also designed to be easy to deploy to [Nodejitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/).

Applications are instances of `Hoodie` objects.  This provides the entry point to most functionality, including user accounts -- Hoodie comes with a baked-in account system.  Data is stored per-user through `hoodie.store`, which is accessible from client-side code.  In this respect it's reminiscent of [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/).

Data lifecycle stages trigger events, so you can easily see when data is changed in some way:

{% highlight javascript %}
hoodie.store.on('add:task', function(event, changedObject) {
  // Update the view with the changedObject
});
{% endhighlight %}

The API is chainable and will remind client-side developers of jQuery.

As a teaser, here are some of the account handling method calls:

{% highlight javascript %}
hoodie.account.signUp('joe@example.com', 'secret');
hoodie.account.changeUsername('currentpassword', 'newusername');
hoodie.account.resetPassword('joe@example.com');
hoodie.account.destroy();
{% endhighlight %}

To start your own project you'll need CouchDB installed locally.  Then you can `npm install -g hoodie-cli`, which will allow you to run `hoodie new` to create a new project.  The process is straightforward if you're already using Node and don't mind running CouchDB, and it's fully documented on Hoodie's website.

The documentation for Hoodie is solid, and I've found it easy to follow so far.  Although I only learned about it at the Great British Node Conference, the developers have been working on it for [over a year](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie.js/commit/bf4865347b1a5eb969d1b645447f5db4d7ca1d6d).  It has sponsors, and is [looking for more](http://hood.ie/sponsoring.html).  It's a well-presented, open source project, with [momentum behind it](http://weekly.hood.ie/).

Talking to Sven Lito at the Great British Node Conference I got the impression that the team are treating it as a commercial project, while believing in the open source model.  This made me want to get on board and use it myself, so I suggest you give it a try.
