  <small>Surely the very reason Emscripten was created?</small>

Finally, my worlds have collided!  In case you didn't know, I regularly write a [Vim blog](http://usevim.com/).  It's surprisingly easy to find things to say about this 22 year old text editor, and it's been my main tool for writing code and articles for a long time.  [Vim.js](http://coolwanglu.github.io/vim.js/web/vim.html) (GitHub: [coolwanglu / vim.js](https://github.com/coolwanglu/vim.js)) by Lu Wang is an Emscripten port of Vim, allowing you to use Vim in a browser.

It runs pretty well on my computer -- it seems fast, and the commands I typically use work.  It's not like these Vim layers for IDEs and other editors that miss certain motions, registers, and so on: it's basically Vim.  Split windows and tabs work, but the help files aren't available (or I can't find them).  The way it works in the browser is to use a `<span>` for each terminal character, which means for the 43x115 example window there are 4945 spans!

From a JavaScript point of view, I found the [Sync to Async Transformation](https://github.com/coolwanglu/vim.js/wiki/Sync-to-Async-Transformation) document interesting.  The author is trying to figure out how to deal with JavaScript's asynchronous nature, given that Vim expects to have a non-busy synchronous `sleep()` function:

> Most works are automatically done by `web/transform.js`, read the comments inside for more detail. But there are a few left, mainly function pointers, which cannot be automatically identified. Whenever vim.js crashes and you see callback function is not specified! in the browser console, congratulations, you have found one more async function at large.

I wonder if there are any Node developers or ES6 experts that can help with this?  If you're interested in the project, there's a [TODO](https://github.com/coolwanglu/vim.js/blob/master/TODO) which has some Emscripten issues and client-side work that needs doing.
