![React](/images/posts/fbreact.png)

[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) (GitHub: [facebook / react](http://github.com/facebook/react), License: _Apache 2.0_, npm: [react-tools](https://npmjs.org/package/react-tools), bower: _react_) from Facebook and Instagram is a UI framework.  It's maintained by [Paul O'Shannessy](https://www.facebook.com/zpao), and Paul and Christopher Chedeau both post to the [React blog](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/) regularly about new features and community news.

React is meant to be a _declarative_ framework, so it focuses on transforming data into interface components.  Data can come from servers and user input -- there's no specific transport layer support, instead other libraries like jQuery are relied on.

The first thing you'll notice about React is it mixes HTML and JavaScript:

{% highlight javascript %}
var HelloMessage = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return <div>{'Hello ' + this.props.name}</div>;
  }
});

React.renderComponent(<HelloMessage name="John" />, mountNode);
{% endhighlight %}

What's going on?  Well, this snippet is intended to be placed inside a `script` tag, with the `type` attribute set to `text/jsx`.  [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) is React's XML-based template language.  It doesn't hit the DOM until it needs to: instead a [mock DOM, or faked browser](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/working-with-the-browser.html) is used to maintain an in-memory representation of your templates.  Be aware that this comes with caveats: everything is escaped by default, so [HTML entities can easily be double escaped](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-gotchas.html).

You don't need to use JSX, however: `React.DOM.div({}, 'Hello ' + this.props.name)` is equivalent to the previous example.

Applications made with React are based on components.  Components are created with `React.createClass` method (not `React.createComponent`).   Components have a "state" and "props": the state is private, and mutable.  If the state is updated, then the component will be re-rendered: this is known as _reactive state_, and is how React models reactive data flows.  React doesn't re-render the entire component, it tries to only render what changed:

> `render()` methods return a description of the DOM, and React can diff this description with the in-memory representation to compute the fastest way to update the browser.

React plays well with Node-based build systems: there's a [Grunt task](https://github.com/ericclemmons/grunt-react) for building JSX, in case you don't want to render everything in the browser.  The documentation has a section on [React's tooling integration](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tooling-integration.html).

The documentation for React is straightforward and easy to follow: [there's a tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) that introduces the main aspects of the framework.  It's difficult to say how it compares to other frameworks like AngularJS, but I like the distinction between mutable and immutable state and properties for modeling reactive data flows.
