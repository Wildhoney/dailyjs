Every day we receive many submissions for Node modules, jQuery plugins, and weird and wonderful JavaScript projects.  However, we're also interested in your articles about JavaScript.  They can be tutorials for projects you've created, or tutorials on well-known projects like AngularJS, Backbone.js, Express, and so on.

Articles don't need to be long -- three to five paragraphs is more than enough given how often we post.  You can cross-post from your own blogs.  We pay for original articles, and will negotiate a fee: as a guide we've paid $25 for short articles in the past.

If you'd like to write for us, send article ideas to [contact.dailyjs.com](http://contact.dailyjs.com/).
