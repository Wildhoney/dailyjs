Cristiano Belloni has relaunched [KievII Host](http://dailyjs.com/2013/03/22/kievll-capturing/) as [Hya.io](http://app.hya.io/).  This is a web-based plugin-based audio application that supports hardware MIDI though [Web MIDI](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/), audio synthesis, sequencers, and lots of plugins.

The project has a [blog](http://blog.hya.io/) with announcements about updates, plugins, and some technical background.  The web interface is closed source, but the plugins Cristiano has written are open source.  For example, [hy-osc](https://github.com/janesconference/hy-osc) is an oscillator, and [kmx](https://github.com/janesconference/kmx) is a mixer.

Hya supports AMD and ES6 modules.  They use a simple JSON object that describes the plugin, and a constructor function.  You can bind to the Hya GUI using various events, like `handleMouseOver` and `handleMouseDown`. The post [Developing a canvas plugin for Hya.io](http://blog.hya.io/developing-a-canvas-plugin-for-hyacinth/) explains how to create plugins in detail.

[The documentation](http://hya.io/#/docs) has details on MIDI interaction and the `initPlugin` constructor.  It's amazing to think that you could connect a MIDI control surface or keyboard to a web application.
