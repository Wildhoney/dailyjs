![Pageres](/images/posts/pageres.png)

Sindre Sorhus sent in pageres (GitHub: [sindresorhus / pageres](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres), License: _MIT_, npm: [pageres](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pageres)), a command-line tool for generating screenshots of websites.

You can install it with `npm install --global pageres`, and then run it with a URL and a size:

{% highlight text %}
pageres http://dailyjs.com/2014/02/12/node-roundup/ --sizes 800x600
{% endhighlight %}

It's based on [webshot](https://www.npmjs.org/package/webshot), which is another small module that wraps around [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).  There are other modules like `pageres`, but what I like about it is the focus on sizes: you could script it to generate screenshots of responsive websites.  The command-line options allow you to specify many dimensions at once, so it's easy to generate results for a responsive site.

This will work well if you've got marketing materials that include screenshots, or if your designers want to see useful outputs from a CI server.

Another cool feature is the Node API:

{% highlight javascript %}
var pageres = require('pageres');

pageres(['todomvc.com'], ['1366x768', '1600x900'], function () {
  console.log('done');
});
{% endhighlight %}

I've made a few lightweight wrappers around PhantomJS before -- there's a HTML to PDF invoice generator in production that I made last year that's been ticking over nicely.  However, I like the focus on dimensions in `pageres`, and the command-line interface is very friendly.
