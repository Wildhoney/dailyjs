###Conference: mloc.js

![mloc.js](/images/posts/mlocjs.png)

[mloc.js](http://mloc-js.com/2014/) is a conference in Budapest, taking place on February 13th.  Tickets start at $260, but there are only 24 left!

> With projects like asm.js and Emscripten, Mozilla is beginning to see JavaScript as a virtual machine and compiler target. Will it change how we think about and how we use JavaScript? How compiling C++ code to really fast JavaScript code will transform the web? At mloc.js we are bringing together representatives of major browser vendors, industrial users with large web projects, and authors of compile-to-JS projects with the goal of moving the web forward. Together we will discuss what will be possible with the web platform in the next 10 years.

There are some great speakers from PayPal, Google, Mozilla, Intel, and more.

###Bootstrap 3.1

It looks like [Bootstrap 3.1 is out](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v3.1.0).  There's an inconsequential and pointless discussion about it on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7151662), so it's probably best to ignore that and read the changelog for yourself.

One of the nice things about this release is it includes some new templates: Blog, Cover, and Dashboard.  Even though I like to code these by hand, it's great for people who want to get started quickly.  The [blog template](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/) doesn't use the `article` element, but they do target IE 8 so that might be why.
