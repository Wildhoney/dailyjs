###Cerebro

[Cerebro](http://cerebro.maxmert.com/) is a WebGL visualisation of Google Analytics data, created by Vetrenko Maxim.  You can use the author's Google Analytics data, or your own -- the project isn't open source, so I decided to use the sample data.

It supports Leap Motion input, and uses three.js, sparks.js, and dancer.js for audio.  I couldn't get it working in Firefox, but it worked in Chrome.

###Snowmen War

[Snowmen War](http://www.impertinents.com/sw/) (License: _CC BY-NC 3.0_) by Tanguy Sauvin and his girlfriend is a WebGL game with some pretty extreme text.  When the game starts, you're warned that "THEY WILL KILL YOU", and if you're hit too many times the game over screen simply states "YOU'RE DEAD."  It's blunt, which is amusing next to the slightly surreal snowmen in outer space visuals.

If you view the project's source you can see the game engine, which uses [Cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js), and plenty of Mr.doob's libraries.

###Cube Game

Mark Vasilkov wanted to make something with [Goo Engine](http://www.gootechnologies.com/), so he came up with [Cube Game](http://animuchan.net/moz_game/).  His advice is to mash the spacebar repeatedly until you win, but I found it was more playable when I realised it's possible to slide under some of tile-like blocks.
