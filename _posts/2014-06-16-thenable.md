If you want to use ES6 promises using the `Promise` object in a library or module, then there's a new implementation that you might want to check out.  Thenable (GitHub: [rse / thenable](https://github.com/rse/thenable), License: _MIT_) by Ralf S. Engelschall is a `Promise` implementation based on [Promises/A+](http://promisesaplus.com/).

> This is a strictly-compliant Promises/A+ 1.1.1 implementation in just 2KB of (compressed) code, which passes the official Promises/A+ Test-Suite and includes back-references to the relevant specification statements. It just provides a minimum Promise functionality, because it is intended to be directly embedded into ECMAScript 5 based libraries and frameworks, in order to dependency-free leverage from Promises and be able to return "thenable" Promise objects to applications.

Because Thenable is a minimum implementation of Promises/A+, it's suited to the creation of libraries that are forwards compatible, rather than for consumption in JavaScript applications.  To reinforce the point, Ralf hasn't published it to npm or Bower.

> Instead, please download the raw thenable.min.js and include it verbatim into your library/framework. The usual approach for this is to temporarily emulate a CommonJS environment within your library/framework to get its Thenable object.

It has a `noConflict` option for browsers, and supports AMD, CommonJS, and browsers.

If you want to use Promises/A+ in your applications, Ralf recommends [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird), and there's a large list of other implementations on the promises spec wiki: [promises-spec / implementations.md](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec/blob/master/implementations.md).
