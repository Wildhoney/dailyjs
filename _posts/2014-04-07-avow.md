I haven't had good experiences with continuous integration systems.  They seem to work fine for a few months until they go senile and I have to nuke and reinstall them.  Kent Safranski sent in [Avow-CI](http://avow-ci.com/) (GitHub: [Fluidbyte / avow-ci](https://github.com/Fluidbyte/avow-ci), License: _MIT_), an open source CI server that's built on Node and MongoDB -- hopefully this one will be different!

Avow supports Git web hooks, so you can automatically run tests when commits are pushed.  It can also be configured to build a specific branch, and allows manual builds to be run.

To add a project to Avow you'll need to add an `avow.json` file to the project's root directory.  This describes the build process as an array of tasks.  Tasks are run with `require('child_process').spawn`, so you could technically trigger anything -- I'd like to try it with `xcodebuild` if I have time.

Sometimes I wish CI servers were just cron jobs that check for a non-zero exit code, but I might be able to learn to like a simple RESTful web application if it can run for a few months without exploding.  The fact Avow accepts an array of commands to run is nicely simple and flexible, but I'm not sure I like the idea of having to add an `avow.json` file to my projects.

One thing I like about Avow is the structure of the code: the "models" are just properties on `module.exports`, and the HTTP routing layer is also super simple.  You should take a look if you make Node web applications.
