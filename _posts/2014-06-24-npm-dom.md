npm-dom (GitHub: [npm-dom](https://github.com/npm-dom)) by Azer Ko√ßulu, Damon Oehlman, Max Ogden, Jake Verbaten, and Tim Oxley is a GitHub organisation that publishes DOM-related modules through npm.

So far there are small modules like new-element (<https://github.com/npm-dom/new-element>) and siblings (<https://github.com/npm-dom/siblings>), but also larger modules like domquery (<https://github.com/npm-dom/domquery>).

There are quite a few modules already.  If you work with Browserify then you might like the way these modules can be consumed.  As an example, take a look at [class-list](https://github.com/npm-dom/class-list):

{% highlight javascript %}
var elem = someElement;
var ClassList = require('class-list');
var cl = ClassList(elem);

cl.add('foo');
cl.remove('bar');
cl.toggle('baz');
{% endhighlight %}

Azer was inspired to create another organisation called [npm-flickr](https://github.com/npm-flickr), which is a set of Flickr-related libraries.
