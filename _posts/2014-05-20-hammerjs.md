[Hammer.js](http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/) has been updated, and the authors have written a notice about the scrolling behaviour in Chrome 35 and IE10.  The [touch-action](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh767313.aspx) CSS property controls how regions are scrolled with touch events -- think panning and zooming.

In older versions of Hammer, this property was set to `none`, so it blocked scrolling.  You can change the default behaviour using the `behavior.touchAction` property:

{% highlight html %}
<script src="hammer.js"></script>
<script>
// enable only vertical scrolling on browsers that support touch-action
// for 1.0.x this is at the stop_default_behavior object
Hammer.defaults.behavior.touchAction = 'pan-y';

// ...your hammer code...etc...
var mc = new Hammer(document.body);
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

Realising that this would confuse people, the Hammer authors have written <a href="https://github.com/EightMedia/hammer.js/wiki/How-to-fix-Chrome-35--and-IE10--scrolling-(touch-action)">How to fix Chrome 35 and IE10 scrolling</a>, so you can update your Hammer-based sites to work correctly in newer browsers.
