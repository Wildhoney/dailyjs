###js13k Winners

![Pest Control](/images/posts/reverse-lemmings.png)

The [js13k winners](http://js13kgames.com/#winners) have been announced.  First place went to [Pest Control: Weasels by Siorki](http://js13kgames.com/entries/pest-control-weasels), which is like Lemmings in reverse -- instead of saving little critters you have to kill them.  It's a surprisingly fun game!

Felipe Alfonso came second with [Extreme Mini Massacre](http://js13kgames.com/entries/extreme-mini-massacre), and Aur√©lio Santos came third with [ap11](http://js13kgames.com/entries/ap11).  This is like a simplified GTA 1 clone, all in 13k!

There are 129 games listed on the site.  Most genres are covered, and there are even some pretty unique ones like [Whistleblower](http://js13kgames.com/entries/whistleblower) which allows you to use the microphone to whistle different pitches to defeat enemies.

The js13k participants get t-shirts and 3.5" diskettes that contain all of the entries.  Just to show off how small browser games can be... For those of us without disk drives, however, the source is at [js13kGames](https://github.com/js13kGames) on GitHub.

###BottleJS

BottleJS (GitHub: [young-steveo / bottlejs](https://github.com/young-steveo/bottlejs), License: _MIT_, Bower: _bottlejs_, npm: [bottlejs](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bottlejs)) by Stephen Young is a dependency injection micro container.

It's inspired by the AngularJS API.  You can register services with `bottle.service('Service', Service)`, and then construct them with `bottle.container.Service`.  Bottle supports middleware, so you can inject functions that intercept requests for providers just before they're made for the first time.

If you're not using AngularJS and have trouble keeping larger applications maintainable and testable, then something like Bottle might help improve your application's structure.  The readme has examples and API documentation to get you started.
