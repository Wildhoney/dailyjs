###Previously

In the [last part](http://dailyjs.com/2013/04/25/angularjs-3/) we looked at fetching and parsing feeds with YQL using Angular's `$http` service.  The commit for that part was `2eae54e`.

This week you'll learn more about Angular's data binding by adding some `input` fields to allow feeds to be added and removed.

If you get stuck at any part of this tutorial, check out the full source here: [commit c9f9d06](https://github.com/alexyoung/djsreader/tree/c9f9d06258f4973018a1cc48c226642bbb32938f).

###Modeling Multiple Feeds

The previous part mapped one feed to a view by using the `$scope.feed` object.  Now we want to support multiple feeds, so we'll need a way of modeling ordered collections of feeds.

The easiest way to do this is simply by using an array.  Feed objects that contain the post items and feed URLs can be pushed onto the array:

{% highlight javascript %}
$scope.feeds = [{
  url: 'http://dailyjs.com/atom.xml',
  items: [ /* Blog posts go here */ ]
}];
{% endhighlight %}

###Rendering Multiple Feeds

The view now needs to be changed to use multiple feeds instead of a single feed.  This can be achieved by using the `ng-repeat` directive to iterate over each one (`app/views/main.html`):

{% highlight html %}
<div ng-repeat="feed in feeds">
  <ul>
    <li ng-repeat="item in feed.items"><a href="{{ item.link.href }}">{{ item.title }}</a></li>
  </ul>
  URL: <input size="80" ng-model="feed.url">
  <button ng-click="fetchFeed(feed)">Update</button>
  <button ng-click="deleteFeed(feed)">Delete</button>
  <hr />
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

The `fetchFeed` and `deleteFeed` methods should be added to `$scope` in the controller, but we'll deal with those later.  First let's add a form to create new feeds.

###Adding Feeds

The view for adding feeds needs to use an `ng-model` directive to bind a value so the controller can access the URL of the new feed:

{% highlight html %}
<div>
  URL: <input size="80" ng-model="newFeed.url">
  <button ng-click="addFeed(newFeed)">Add Feed</button>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

The `addFeed` method will be triggered when the button is clicked.  All we need to do is push `newFeed` onto `$scope.feed` then clear `newFeed` so the form will be reverted to its previous state.  The `addFeed` method is also added to `$scope` in the controller (`app/scripts/controllers/main.js`), like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
$scope.addFeed = function(feed) {
  $scope.feeds.push(feed);
  $scope.fetchFeed(feed);
  $scope.newFeed = {};
};
{% endhighlight %}

This example could be written to use `$scope.newFeed` instead of the `feed` argument, but don't you think it's cool that arguments can be passed from the view just by adding it to the directive?

###Fetching Feeds

The original `$http` code should be wrapped up as a method so it can be called by the `ng-click` directive on the button:

{% highlight javascript %}
$scope.fetchFeed = function(feed) {
  feed.items = [];

  var apiUrl = "http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20xml%20where%20url%3D'";
  apiUrl += encodeURIComponent(feed.url);
  apiUrl += "'%20and%20itemPath%3D'feed.entry'&format=json&diagnostics=true&callback=JSON_CALLBACK";

  $http.jsonp(apiUrl).
    success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
      if (data.query.results) {
        feed.items = data.query.results.entry;
      }
    }).
    error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
      console.error('Error fetching feed:', data);
    });
};
{% endhighlight %}

The `feed` argument will be the same as the one in the `$scope.feeds` array, so by clearing the current set of items using `feed.items = [];` the user will see instant feedback when "Update" is clicked.  That makes it easier to see what's happening if the feed URL is changed to another URL.

I've used `encodeURIComponent` to encode the feed's URL so it can be safely inserted as a query parameter for Yahoo's service.

###Deleting Feeds

The controller also needs a method to delete feeds.  Since we're working with an array we can just `splice` off the desired item:

{% highlight javascript %}
$scope.deleteFeed = function(feed) {
  $scope.feeds.splice($scope.feeds.indexOf(feed), 1);
};
{% endhighlight %}

###Periodic Updates

Automatically refreshing feeds is an interesting case in AngularJS because it can be implemented using the `$timeout` service.  It's just a wrapper around `setTimeout`, but it also delegates exceptions to `$exceptionHandler`.

To use it, add it to the list of arguments in the controller and set a sensible default value:

{% highlight javascript %}
angular.module('djsreaderApp')
  .controller('MainCtrl', function($scope, $http, $timeout) {
    $scope.refreshInterval = 60;
{% endhighlight %}

Now make `fetchFeed` call itself, at the end of the method:

{% highlight javascript %}
$timeout(function() { $scope.fetchFeed(feed); }, $scope.refreshInterval * 1000);
{% endhighlight %}

I've multiplied the value by `1000` so it converts seconds into milliseconds, which makes the view easier to understand:

{% highlight html %}
<p>Refresh (seconds): <input ng-model="refreshInterval"></p>
{% endhighlight %}

###Conclusion

Now you can add more feeds to the reader, it's starting to feel more like a real web application.  Over the next few weeks I'll add tests and a better interface.
