###git-html5.js

![Tailor](/images/posts/tailorgit.png)

[git-html5.js](http://tin.cr/tailor.html) (GitHub: [ryanackley / git-html5.js](https://github.com/ryanackley/git-html5.js), License: _MIT_) by Ryan Ackley is a Git implementation for JavaScript:

> git-html5.js is a pure JavaScript git client library. It implements a complete Git workflow in nothing but JavaScript. It's meant to run in a browser environment and depends on so-called "html5" APIs. Some example use cases:

Ryan took Adobe's Brackets app, ported to run as a Chrome packaged app, and then added git-html5.js to create an editor that can read and write to Git repositories.  I've tried out the basics and it seems to work pretty well.

The project includes tests and build instructions, but you can just run the [Tailor app in Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tailor/mfakmogheanjhlgjhpijkhdjegllgenf) if you want to try it out.

###TodoMVC 1.2

Sindre Sorhus sent in [TodoMVC 1.2](http://tastejs.roon.io/), an update to the monster MV asterisk collection:

> We released TodoMVC 1.2 yesterday with some new app examples of frameworks from Google (Polymer), Twitter (Flight) and Facebook (React), and other improvements.

If you're interested in seeing what a small but functional Polymer project looks like, then [check it out](http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/polymer/index.html)!
