  <small>The Nutty SSH sharing service.</small>
</div>

[Nutty](https://nutty.io/) (GitHub: [krishnasrinivas / nuttyapp](https://github.com/krishnasrinivas/nuttyapp), License: _GPLv3_) by Krishna Srinivas is a Meteor application that allows SSH sessions to be shared via a browser.  A host connects to a server which can then be shared with other people.  Krishna suggests that this could be useful for pair programming or support.

The Nutty server needs some configuration before you can run it yourself -- you can set up Google authentication, and it needs Amazon S3 for uploading recordings to S3.  If you want to use WebRTC then you can set up [PeerJS](http://peerjs.com/) as well.

It's an interesting example of Meteor and HTML5 being used to provide a service that would be traditionally run as a system-level daemon.
