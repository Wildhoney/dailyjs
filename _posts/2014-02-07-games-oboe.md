###One HTML5 Game Per Week

![Princess Quest](/images/posts/princessquest.png)

Thomas Palef sent in [his project to create one HTML5 game a week](http://www.lessmilk.com/).  He's created seven games so far, including [Princess Quest](http://www.lessmilk.com/6/), a vertical jumping game that uses [Phaser](http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser).

He's also posting [short blog posts](http://blog.lessmilk.com/pixel-art-how-i-made-the-princess-in-game-6/) about how he makes the games.

###Oboe.js

[Oboe.js](http://oboejs.com/) (GitHub: [jimhigson / oboe.js](https://github.com/jimhigson/oboe.js), License: _BSD_, Bower: _oboe_, npm: [oboe](https://npmjs.org/package/oboe)) is a library for handling JSON HTTP responses before the request has finished:

> It glues a transport that sits somewhere between streaming and downloading to a JSON parser that sits somewhere between SAX and DOM. It is small enough to be a micro-library, doesn't have any external dependencies and doesn't care which other libraries you need it to speak to.

The website has a video and more documentation that explains how it works.
