###Node 0.9.11

[Node 0.9.11](http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/03/01/node-v0-9-11-unstable/) was released last week, which has more changes for the new streams API.  The `_read` method no longer takes a callback, which means your current `_read` methods need to be updated to call `push()` instead.  If you're unsure about the new API, Node's tests (in [test/simple](https://github.com/joyent/node/tree/master/test/simple)) are useful for figuring out what to do.

These updates were pulled into [isaacs/readable-stream](https://github.com/isaacs/readable-stream), which is a module that allows you to use _streams2_ in Node 0.8.  If you haven't tried it yet, I recommend attempting to migrate your pre-0.10 custom streams to it, at least to prepare for Node 0.10.

###clinch

clinch (GitHub: [Meettya / clinch](https://github.com/Meettya/clinch), License: _MIT_, npm: [clinch](https://npmjs.org/package/clinch)) by Meettya is a CommonJS module to browser build system.  It has a lot of features, some of which streamline working with CoffeeScript and Jade:

* Builds are generated by analysing the source code
* A fake global `require` function _is not used_, which means the client-side overheads are relatively low
* It supports pre-compilation of Jade templates
* And, it emulates Node globals, like `process`

The author has provided tests, but at the moment the documentation could do with some work -- it's written in English which isn't the author's native language, so perhaps someone could help him with that?

###review

Julian Gruber sent in a whole bunch of modules, but the one I thought was cool was _review_ (GitHub: [juliangruber / review](https://github.com/juliangruber/review), License: _MIT_, npm: [review](https://npmjs.org/package/review)).  This module can be used to generate screenshots of sites according to various parameters -- you could use it to check designs at various resolutions, for example.

Julian also sent in [jilla](https://github.com/godmodelabs/jilla) which is a command-line client for JIRA, and [statsc](https://github.com/godmodelabs/statsc), a browser library for graphite/statsd servers.
