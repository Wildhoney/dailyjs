This year we saw [Node 0.10](http://dailyjs.com/2013/03/11/node-stable/) released, [Bootstrap 3](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2013/08/19/bootstrap-3-released/), and [jQuery 2.0](http://blog.jquery.com/2013/04/18/jquery-2-0-released/).  People are getting increasingly excited about [WebGL gaming](http://dailyjs.com/2013/12/06/notch-npm_lazy/), and client-side frameworks like AngularJS and Backbone.js are maturing and growing in popularity.

The highlight of 2013 for me was speaking at the [Great British Node Conference](http://greatbritishnodeconf.co.uk/).  I'd been researching Node's internals for the book I'm working on, so it felt like all that work culminated in a talk that got people thinking more about Node's JavaScript and C++.

Over the next year I expect ECMAScript 6 to become more widely used.  If you want to keep track of this standard, I find [@esdiscuss](https://twitter.com/esdiscuss) to be the most digestible way to keep track of things.

Happy holidays to everyone who reads DailyJS, and I look forward to writing more over the next year!
