Agenda (GitHub: [rschmukler / agenda](https://github.com/rschmukler/agenda), License: _MIT_, npm: [agenda](https://www.npmjs.org/package/agenda)) by Ryan Schmukler is a job scheduler for Node that uses MongoDB as the backend.  It runs periodically, so you'd need to run it as a background process on something like Heroku or Nodejitsu.

You can control the number of concurrent jobs with the `concurrency` option, and jobs can be given a priority so higher priority jobs can run first.

Basic usage looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
agenda.define('delete old users', function(job, done) {
  User.remove({lastLogIn: { $lt: twoDaysAgo }}, done);
});

agenda.every('3 minutes', 'delete old users');

agenda.every('*/3 * * * *', 'delete old users');

agenda.start();
{% endhighlight %}

The last example looks like cron, so you can use it as a cron replacement if you're used to that syntax.  The `agenda.start` method kicks off the process so jobs will run.

The MongoDB instance can be specified using the `database` method, and configuration options can be chained:

{% highlight javascript %}
var agenda = new Agenda();
agenda
  .database(...)
  .processEvery('3 minutes')
{% endhighlight %}

Agenda was recently featured as an npmawesome post on Nodejitsu's blog: [Schedule regular jobs with agenda](http://blog.nodejitsu.com/npmawesome-agenda/).
