Is (GitHub: [jumpkick-studios / Is](https://github.com/jumpkick-studios/is), License: _MIT_) by Alex Bogartz cuts down conditional statements with a more declarative API.  It's inspired by the [Maybe monad](http://bit.ly/1o0XbM4) pattern.

The author compares a lengthy, nested conditional statement to his chainable alternative:

{% highlight javascript %}
new Is(foo)
  .isLongerThan(0)
  .equals('bar')
  .not().equals('bar2')
  .then(() => {
    console.log('success')
  })
  .catch(() => {
    throw new Error('bad foo');
  });
{% endhighlight %}

The main library's source and tests are written with TypeScript, which means it looks very similar to standard JavaScript with the addition of type hints and succinct lambda expressions.  You don't have to use TypeScript to use it, but I think it reads quite nicely that way.

One nice feature of this library is you can avoid the need for checking for undefined values.  For example, given `var foo = { bar: undefined }`:

{% highlight javascript %}
new Is(foo.bar)
  .isLongerThan(3)
  .catch(() => {
    console.log('Please provide "bar"');
  })
{% endhighlight %}

The code in `catch` will run even if `foo.bar` is undefined.
