[Espruino](http://www.espruino.com/) is a cheap and tiny microcontroller that can be scripted with JavaScript.  That means you can use JavaScript and an Arduino-inspired API to communicate with sensors, motors, and LCD displays.  Rather than using Arduino's Processing-derived IDE, or Node modules to communicate with Arduino, you can use something designed with JavaScript in mind from the ground up.

There's an official [Espruino board](http://www.espruino.com/ReferenceESPRUINOBOARD), but there are also compatible boards that you can use.  The Espruino firmware can be installed on the other boards manually, so if you've already dabbled with microcontrollers you should be able to get a compatible board loaded up and ready to run.  The [Espruino hardware reference](http://www.espruino.com/ReferenceESPRUINOBOARD) has more details.

The Raspberry Pi has some IO pins (the GPIO connector), but microcontroller-based boards like the Espruino use much less power.  That means you could leave a board running on batteries for a significant amount of time.

The [project was successfully funded on Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/48651611/espruino-javascript-for-things), where they raised &pound;100,710.

If you want to flash a compatible microcontroller check out [Espruino's downloads page](http://www.espruino.com/Download).  If you want to see the source, go to [espruino / Espruino](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino).  It contains a JavaScript lexer and parser, because the author (Gordon Williams) found V8 and SpiderMonkey used too much RAM to run on the chips he wanted to target.  Have a look at the [C source code](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/tree/master/src) if you're interested in seeing how it works.
