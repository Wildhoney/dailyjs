Obelisk.js (GitHub: [nosir / obelisk.js](https://github.com/nosir/obelisk.js), License: _MIT_) by Max Huang is a library for building isometric graphics.

> With the simple and flexible API provided by this engine, you can easily add isometric pixel element like brick, cube, pyramid onto HTML5 canvas. Obelisk.js strictly follows the pixel neat pattern: lines with 1:2 pixel dot arrangement, leading to an angle of 22.6 degrees.

Max has written some cool examples, like [a GIF to isometric convertor](http://codepen.io/nosir/details/mdiHe) and [text rendering](http://codepen.io/nosir/details/IxBJn).

There are also tutorials that introduce the basics, like [building cubes](https://github.com/nosir/obelisk.js/wiki/Tutorial-Part-1%3A-To-build-the-first-cube) and [other primitives](https://github.com/nosir/obelisk.js/wiki/Tutorial-Part-3%3A-Primitives).

To draw a cube, you need to get an instance of a dimension, colour, and the `Cube` primitive.  The library uses its own wrappers for colours and dimensions to set up the right co-ordinates and shading for the isometric effect:

{% highlight javascript %}
var point = new obelisk.Point(270, 120);
var pixelView = new obelisk.PixelView(canvas, point);

var dimension = new obelisk.CubeDimension(120, 200, 60);
var color = new obelisk.CubeColor().getByHorizontalColor(obelisk.ColorPattern.GRAY);
var cube = new obelisk.Cube(dimension, color);
pixelView.renderObject(cube);
{% endhighlight %}

The base class is `obelisk.AbstractPrimitive`, which `Cube` inherits from.  There's a `demo/` directory with more examples.
