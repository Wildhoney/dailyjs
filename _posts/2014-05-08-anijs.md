[AniJS](http://anijs.github.io/) (GitHub: [anijs / anijs](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/), License: _MIT_) by Dariel Noel Vila Plagado is a declarative library for CSS animations.  There's a cool example that illustrates the [sentence definition API](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/wiki/Sentence-Definitions), where the API calls are broken up into a form with separate fields for "if, on, do, to":

The actual markup uses data attributes to define the animation behaviour: `data-anijs="if: click, on: footer, do: swing"`.

The generalised format for this is explained using a simple text diagram in the [wiki](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/wiki/Handling-Animations):

{% highlight text %}
Declaration - Sentence 1; ... ; Sentence n
Sentence    - Definition, ... , Definition n
Definition  - if | on | do | to | before | after | helper
{% endhighlight %}

You can also create animations in JavaScript with `AniJS.createAnimation`.

The project's wiki has lots of documentation already, with details on how to [write before and after functions](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/wiki/Writing-before-and-after-functions), [run animations repeatedly](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/wiki/Running-AniJS-repeatedly), and [write animations entirely with JavaScript](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/wiki/Handling-Animations-Using-JavaScript).  Parts of the documentation are in Spanish, but there's enough English in the code examples and comments that I was able to understand it.
