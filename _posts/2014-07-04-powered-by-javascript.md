[Powered by JavaScript](http://www.manning.com/poweredbyjavascript/) is a conference organised by Manning, the publisher of my book [Node.js in Practice](http://manning.com/young/).  My co-author, Marc Harter, is speaking, along with Tim Caswell and Ben Acker.  For a full list of speakers see <http://www.manning.com/poweredbyjavascript/>.

The conference will be held in St. Louis on September 17, 2014.  Early bird tickets are $250, and tickets at the door will be $500.

Manning are looking for sponsors, and there's a [PDF with more details](http://www.manning.com/poweredbyjavascript/PBJS_prospectus.pdf).
