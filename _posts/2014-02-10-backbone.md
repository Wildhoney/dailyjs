###Kettle.js

[Kettle.js](http://smelnikov.github.io/kettle/) (GitHub: [smelnikov / kettle](https://github.com/smelnikov/kettle), License: _MIT_) by Sergey Melnikov is an alternative approach to Backbone views that uses a declarative syntax to define elements, their bindings, and their associated events.

It supports two-way data binding, sub views, and can be extended to support custom Kettle elements.

###Mem.js

Mem.js (GitHub: [artyomtrityak / mem.js](https://github.com/artyomtrityak/mem.js), License: _MIT_) by Artyom Trityak is a memory management library for Backbone.  It allows you to save, retrieve, and destroy instances of Backbone classes:

{% highlight javascript %}
var View = Backbone.View({});

// On set returns new stored function instance or object
var headerViewIns = Mem.set('headerView', View, { el: 'body' });
{% endhighlight %}

It can remove and recreate instances with `Mem.reset`, and remove outdated objects with `Mem.manage`.

###Backbone.SuperModel

Backbone.SuperModel (GitHub: [laoshanlung/backbone.supermodel](https://github.com/laoshanlung/backbone.supermodel), License: _MIT_, npm: [backbone.supermodel](https://npmjs.org/package/backbone.supermodel)) by Tan Nguyen is model class that offers support for nested collections.  It supports dot notation for getters and setters, and an updated `toJSON` that reflects the nested structure.  Relationships can be defined between models as well.

{% highlight javascript %}
var wallet = {
  money: {
    amount: 4000,
    currency: 'euro'
  },
  name: 'Tan Nguyen'
};

var myStuff = new Backbone.Model();
myStuff.set('wallet', wallet);
myStuff.get('wallet').money.amount; // 4000
{% endhighlight %}

The project includes tests and benchmarks, and examples can be found in the readme.
