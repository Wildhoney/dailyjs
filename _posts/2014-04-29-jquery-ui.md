As of version 1.11 you can use [AMD with jQuery UI](http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/environments/amd/).  RequireJS will work, or any other AMD compatible loader.

That means you can do this:

{% highlight javascript %}
require(['jquery-ui/autocomplete'], function(autocomplete) {
  autocomplete({ source: ['One', 'Two', 'Three'] }, '<input>')
    .element
    .appendTo('body');
});
{% endhighlight %}

Doesn't that look a lot better than what we had before (script tags, monolithic `$`)?  The old [Autocomplete](http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/) style would have used `$(selector).autocomplete`, which is low on syntax but high in coupling.  Even though Autocomplete's API is always going to be coupled to jQuery, I prefer the idea of being able to load it in a modular way, and to potentially be able to inject a different dependency.

The jQuery/jQuery UI stack is still more monolithic than some of the newer MVVM or component-based solutions, but this may help you use some AMD-based techniques with your existing jQuery UI projects.

Also, I know there's always someone who wants to point out how great Dojo is, so here's [Dojo's AMD post from 2011](http://dojotoolkit.org/blog/learn-more-about-amd).
