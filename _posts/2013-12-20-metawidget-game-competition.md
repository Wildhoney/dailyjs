###Metawidget

Richard Kennard sent in [Metawidget](http://metawidget.org/):

> Metawidget is a smart widget that populates itself, either statically or at runtime, with UI components to match the properties of your business objects.

I originally replied to him and said that something that talks about "business objects" and Java Struts might not be the type of thing I usually write about on DailyJS.  He responded in good spirits with this:

> Metawidget is a lightweight UI generator that can turn a JSON object into a UI widget in one line of code:
> <http://blog.kennardconsulting.com/2013/08/how-to-generate-ui-from-json-objects.html>
>
> Or three lines if not using AngularJS:
> <http://blog.kennardconsulting.com/2013/03/lightweight-json-to-ui-generator.html>
> <http://blog.kennardconsulting.com/2013/07/generate-ui-from-json.html>
>
> Also supports JQuery UI and JQuery Mobile:
> <http://blog.kennardconsulting.com/2013/12/jquery-mobile-ui-generator.html>

If you come from a C# or Java background, the style of this project might appeal to you.  The [introductory tutorial](http://metawidget.sourceforge.net/doc/reference/en/html/ch01s02.html) explains the idea of transforming data into UI elements based on types (which reminds me of my XSLT days).

###Mozilla Holiday Gaming Competition

Kevin Attfield sent in a competition being run by Mozilla and [Goo Technologies](http://www.gootechnologies.com/) with [$45,000 worth of prizes up for grabs](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/12/05/unleash-the-game-creator-in-you-by-entering-our-holiday-gaming-competition/).

> To create your games, you will be using the Goo platform consisting of Goo Engine - a 3D JavaScript gaming engine entirely built on WebGL/HTML5 - and Goo Create - a visual editing tool running on top of the engine. For inspiration, check out this video tutorial on how to create an interactive scene in Goo Create.

Kevin works for Goo Technologies, and said [they're also looking for developers](http://about.gootechnologies.com/jobs).
