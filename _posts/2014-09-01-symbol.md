LiLL (GitHub: [BlackDice / lill](https://github.com/BlackDice/lill), License: _MIT_, npm: [lill](https://www.npmjs.org/package/lill)) is a linked list implementation that uses the [ECMAScript 6 Symbol API](http://tc39wiki.calculist.org/es6/symbols/).  Because `Symbol` isn't widely implemented, the author has used [es6-symbol](https://www.npmjs.org/package/es6-symbol).

The motivation behind using `Symbol` is to provide a stateless public API with a low memory footprint.  The ES6 wiki describes one of the use cases for `Symbol` as lightweight information hiding, so a linked list seems like a good example.  In LiLL, information about neighbours is stored on the actual items, so you can hop from item to item without creating an entirely new data structure.

LiLL is attached to an owner object using `Lill.attach`, then you can call `Lill.getNext(owner, item)` or `getPrevious`.  There are also methods for getting the head and tail.

To build and iterate over a list, you could do this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var Lill = require('lill');
var scores = {};
Lill.attach(scores);
Lill.add(scores, { name: 'AAA', score: 1000 });
Lill.add(scores, { name: 'ZZZ', score: 900 });

var item = Lill.getHead(scores);

while (item) {
  console.log('High score:', item.name, item.score);
  item = Lill.getNext(scores, item);
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you run this in Node's REPL you'll see entries with `@@lill related data` added to the owner object (`scores`), which describe the linked list.  When `Symbol` is available without a shim then this will become symbols instead.
