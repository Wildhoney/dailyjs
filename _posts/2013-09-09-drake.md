[Drake](http://marksteve.com/drake/) (GitHub: [marksteve / drake](https://github.com/marksteve/drake), License: _MIT_) by Mark Steve Samson is a password management tool.  It syncs with Google Drive, and uses [SJCL](http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/) for client-side encryption.

It has a simple password generation feature -- it just creates a random string, so you can select a portion from it.  It would be nice if it had some options for length and punctuation like 1Password.

The interesting thing about Drake is it's entirely client-side.  It uses Google's APIs to sync data, but runs in your browser.  Mark said he developed it using Chrome, so it could be a password management solution for Chromebook users who don't want to sync all of their passwords using Chrome's built-in system.

The code is organised using TJ Holowaychuk's [Component](https://github.com/component/component) project, and can be built locally using `make`.
