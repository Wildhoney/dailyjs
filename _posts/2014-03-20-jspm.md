![jspm.io](/images/posts/jspmio.png)

[jspm.io](http://jspm.io/) (GitHub: [jspm / jspm-cli](https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli), License: _Apache 2.0_, npm: [jspm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jspm)) by Guy Bedford is a browser package manager that supports the ES6, AMD, and CommonJS module formats.  It uses [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) to load modules based on the ES6 module loader specification.

Loading modules in browsers looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
// a specific module from the latest version of an npm package:
System.import('npm:lodash-node/modern/collections').then(function(collections) {
  collections.max([1,2,3,4]); // 4
});

// a semver-compatible version of jquery:
System.import('github:components/jquery@^2.0.3').then(function($) {
});
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that it allows modules to be loaded based on semantic version numbers -- you can use it to load modules from a CDN this way, or on the command-line: `jspm install npm:lodash-node jquery@^2.0.3`.

The design of the API means you can use ES6 modules now, but still get the benefits of a Node-powered command-line tool for quickly downloading and building local bundles.

It has its own [registry](https://github.com/jspm/registry), so naturally the author is looking for pull requests to get new modules listed.  The current registries use SPDY, which has some advantages for a module loading system.  Once you're ready to roll out projects to production, you can use the `jspm` command-line tool to inject package configuration and specific versions of the dependencies.
