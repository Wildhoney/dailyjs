VLEX (GitHub: [indus / VLEX](https://github.com/indus/VLEX), License: _MIT_) by Stefan Keim is a library for defining the logic necessary to resize SVG images.  It works using a `vlex` attribute that controls how things are resized, and there's also a `VLEX` function for initialising and updating elements.

A "vlexpression" contains property descriptions separated by semi-colons.  Using a `$` allows predefined values to be referenced: `$x` is `element.clientWidth`, and `$cX` is `$x / 2` -- the horizontal centre.  Using a colon allows a value to be set: `key:value`.

Given those rules, you can [centre a circle](http://rawgit.com/indus/VLEX/master/vlexamples/1_basic/1_circle.html) with `cx:{$cX};cy:{$cY}`.

Internally it splits the expression with `String.prototype.split(';')`, and then splits on `:` to get the keys and values.  It's a fairly simple parser, but it seems small and flexible enough to do get some clever effects using SVG.  Take a look at the examples in the readme to see what's possible.
