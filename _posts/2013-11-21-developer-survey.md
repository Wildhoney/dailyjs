[Every year](http://dailyjs.com/tags.html#surveys) I like to run a survey for the readers of DailyJS.  It helps me figure out what I should write about, but I also share the results with the community so you can use the data however you wish.

This year I've decided to change the approach.  A draft of the survey questions can be found on GitHub, here: [alexyoung / dailyjs-survey](https://github.com/alexyoung/dailyjs-survey).  You can fork it and send pull requests for questions you'd like to add or change.

After a week or so I'll compile the changes into a Google Drive form and announce the survey has gone live so people can submit their responses.

I'd really appreciate input on the survey before publishing it, because it helps us get a better idea about what's going on in the world of client-side and server-side JavaScript development.
