[Ripple.js](http://ripplejs.github.io/) (GitHub: [ripplejs / ripple](https://github.com/ripplejs/ripple), License: _MIT_) from Segment.io is a library for templating and data binding.  It's based around templates, and has a chainable API, allowing plugins to be added to components:

{% highlight javascript %}
var Person = ripple('<div>{{name}}</div>')
  .use(events)
  .use(each)
  .use(dispatch);

var person = new Person({
  name: 'Tom'
});

person.appendTo(document.body);
{% endhighlight %}

The plugins can add directives in a similar way to AngularJS: [take a look at each](https://github.com/ripplejs/each), for example.

There's a [JSFiddle Markdown example](http://jsfiddle.net/anthonyshort/QGK3r/light/) that uses a template embedded in a `script` element, and two plugins: `ripple.events` and `ripple.markdown`.  The plugins allow changes to be observed on the `textarea` and Markdown is set to render using a directive on a `div` element.

One of the features that I like is the pattern for [view composition](https://github.com/ripplejs/ripple/tree/master/docs/composing).  Views can be embedded, and data will still be synced when it changes.

Also, the library seems [well tested](https://github.com/ripplejs/ripple/tree/master/test), so you can get more usage ideas from the tests.
