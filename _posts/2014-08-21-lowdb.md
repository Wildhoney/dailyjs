LowDB (GitHub: [typicode / lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb), License: _MIT_, npm: [lowdb](https://www.npmjs.org/package/lowdb)) by typicode is a JSON database that uses Lo-Dash.  Rather than using a MongoDB-inspired API, it feels more like functional JavaScript.

Data is queried using familiar chained operators, ending in `value` when you want to obtain the result:

{% highlight javascript %}
var topFiveSongs = low('posts')
  .where({ published: true })
  .sortBy('views')
  .first(5)
  .value();
{% endhighlight %}

LowDB accepts some configuration options, allowing you to control how it behaves.  For example, if you want to use it like an in-memory database, then you can set `autoSave` to `false`:

{% highlight javascript %}
var low = require('lowdb')
low.autoSave = false;
{% endhighlight %}

There's also a short syntax API for the basic operations.  To perform a `where` query, you can do this:

{% highlight javascript %}
low('songs', {title: 'low!'})
// -> low('songs').where({title: 'low!'}).value()

low('songs', {published: false}, {published: true})
// -> low('songs').updateWhere({published: false}, {published: true}).value()
{% endhighlight %}

It doesn't seem to work with `localStorage`, which I think would be cool, but it might work with Browserify.
