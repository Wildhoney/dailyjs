![Firefox donations](/images/posts/firefox-donate.png)

Recently Firefox prompted me to donate to Mozilla.  The ad appeared on the Firefox Start Page, but you might not always see it -- sometimes there's a message that reads "Let the world know you #ChooseIndependent with Firefox."  I switch between browsers for testing quite a lot, so I'm not particularly tied to one browser.  However, that day I'd been using the latest Firefox and the [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/), so I was in a good mood about Mozilla and decided to donate a few dollars.

I happen to think that you should donate as well, and here's why.  The Mozilla Foundation has been involved with some projects that have been immensely useful and powerful: Firefox, PDF.js (Mozilla Labs), [asm.js](https://github.com/dherman/asm.js), and Rust spring to mind.  Take a look at the [Mozilla Research Projects](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/research/projects/) list for more.

Something that JavaScript developers can't live without is the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) documentation.  I almost felt like I was donating to support that site alone!

Like you I also use Chrome, and I actually like Google's email indexing and Google Now -- the way it shows delivery information for recent purchases is awesome.  So I'm not pro-Firefox due to any privacy issues.  And Safari is totally gorgeous on Yosemite.  It definitely feels like Firefox's competition is strong, and [the mainstream technology press is down on Firefox](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/28/whats-next-for-firefox/).  The last few releases have felt as fast as Chrome though, and the UI is evolving to something clean and minimalist that I like.

I think Mozilla does a lot for us JavaScript developers.  If you'd like to donate, go to [sendto.mozilla.org](https://sendto.mozilla.org/page/contribute/givenow-seq#page-1).  There's also [a FAQ about donations](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Donate).  You can now even donate bitcoin!
