Retext (GitHub: [wooorm / retext](https://github.com/wooorm/retext), License: _MIT_, npm: [retext](https://www.npmjs.org/package/retext)) by Titus Wormer is an extensible module for analysing and manipulating natural language text.  It's built on two other modules by the same author.  One is [TextOM](https://github.com/wooorm/textom/), which provides an object system for manipulating text, and the other is [ParseLatin](https://github.com/wooorm/parse-latin).

Given some text, ParseLatin returns syntax trees:

{% highlight javascript %}
parseLatin.parse('A simple sentence.');
/*
 * ˅ Object
 *    ˃ children: Array[1]
 *      type: "RootNode"
 *    ˃ __proto__: Object
 */
{% endhighlight %}

These trees can then be processed as required.  You can iterate over nodes or search them for values, it's a bit like a DOM for plain text (or syntax/grammar).

The Retext module has lots of plugins.  One example is an implementation of the [Metaphone algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone) -- [retext-double-metaphone](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-double-metaphone).  There's also a [short-code emoji parser](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-emoji), so you can actually build tightly focused text-processing modules with Retext.  Another similar plugin is [a typographic parsing library](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-smartypants), which converts ASCII to HTML entities.

One cool use of Retext would be natural language date parsing, which is something that in my experience always ends up in a horrible mess of regular expressions.  The author is still looking for a "retext-date" implementation, so it would be interesting to see what that looks like in Retext.
