[Pojo Viz](http://maurizzzio.github.io/PojoViz/public/vulcanize.html#readme) (GitHub: [maurizzzio / PojoViz](https://github.com/maurizzzio/PojoViz/), License: _MIT_) by Mauricio Poppe is a JavaScript code visualisation tool.  It shows plain objects and how they're related, so you can quickly see that [AngularJS](http://maurizzzio.github.io/PojoViz/public/vulcanize.html#render:angular) has a fairly wide and flat hierarchy, where as [Lo-Dash](http://maurizzzio.github.io/PojoViz/public/vulcanize.html#render:lodash) is very tall.

It works by analysing the global entry point to a library, then iterating over each property.  If an object is encountered, then the properties of that object are recursed until a predefined maximum number of levels is reached.

You can use it to look at JavaScript's [built-in objects and types](http://maurizzzio.github.io/PojoViz/public/vulcanize.html#render:builtIn), although `window` is presented [as a special case](http://maurizzzio.github.io/PojoViz/public/vulcanize.html#render:window) because it's quite large.

It supports two renderers: SVG and WebGL.  These use d3 and three.js, and it uses Polymer and Browserify as well.
