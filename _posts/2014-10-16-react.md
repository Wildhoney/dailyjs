###Omniscient.js

[Omniscient.js](http://omniscientjs.github.io/) (GitHub: [omniscientjs / omniscient](https://github.com/omniscientjs/omniscient), License: _MIT_, npm: [omniscient](https://www.npmjs.org/package/omniscient)) by Mikael Brevik and [Torgeir](https://twitter.com/torgeir) is a React library for rendering components using immutable data.  This is ideal for use with [Immutable.js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js), but other libraries could be used as well.

It uses cursors, so the outer immutable structure swapped when a component's data is changed.  This might sound like it would perform badly, but it only re-renders component trees that reference changed data.

The module is used by wrapping components with the `omniscient` function.  The author's examples call this "component".  These components only deal with their own piece of data, so they're nicely encapsulated and potentially easier to reuse.

The project has [lots of examples](http://omniscientjs.github.io/examples) and documentation, so it's worth reading through the readme first to get a feel for it.

###Path.js Update

![Path.js](/images/posts/pathjsgraphtree.png)

Andrea Ferretti wrote in to say [Paths.js](http://andreaferretti.github.io/paths-js-demo/) has been updated to include tree charts, waterfall diagrams, Sankey diagrams and a preliminary version of force-directed graphs.

This is what the tree chart looks like:

{% highlight coffeescript %}
tree = new Ractive
  el: '#tree'
  template: template
  data:
    Tree: Tree
    data: ducks
    children: children
    width: 350
    height: 300
    leaf: (point) ->
      not (children(point)?.length)

tree.on 'toggle', (event) ->
  node = event.context.item
  node.collapsed = not node.collapsed
  @update()
{% endhighlight %}

The author is also working on performance improvements and lots of other cool stuff, so it's worth keeping an eye on this library.

###Coinbolt Cat Shop

JP Richardson sent in [Coinbolt Cat Shop](https://www.coinbolt.com/catshop/) (GitHub: [coinbolt / catshop](https://github.com/coinbolt/catshop), License: _MIT_).  This is an example of a React.js shopping cart, intended to be used with Bitcoins.

The author points out that you can actually use it with fake Bitcoins for testing purposes.
