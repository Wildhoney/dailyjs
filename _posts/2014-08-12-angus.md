Build tools are great, but they're usually optimised for working on single projects.  If you're a freelancer or work for an agency, then you probably work on multiple projects for several clients each day. Angus (GitHub: [nickjanssen / angus](https://github.com/nickjanssen/angus), License: _MIT_) by Nick Janssen aims to help improve exactly that type of workflow by sharing a build configuration across all of your applications.

> Angus solves these problems by turning the build process into something generic and reusable. It allows you to specify libraries on a per-app basis, while still sharing the same build steps.
>
> Inside Angus, every app is simply a directory inside the `apps/a folder with its own repository. The apps/ folder gets ignored by the Angus repository. Each app you make with Angus shares the same global `Gruntfile`, but can define all the libraries they need on a per-app level.

Each application can still have its own dependencies.  Bower is used for client-side dependencies, but rather than using `bower.json` files Angus invokes Bower with the necessary package names and version strings.

Nick posted an article to David Walsh's blog about Angus: [Building Web Apps Faster Using Angus](http://davidwalsh.name/building-web-apps-faster-angus).  It details the installation and configuration process and also shows how to use Angus with Git.
