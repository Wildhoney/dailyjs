###13 Steps to AngularJS Modularization

Christopher Hiller is writing a three part series about [writing modular AngularJS](http://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2014/03/27/13-step-guide-angularjs-modularization/):

> AngularJS is not a silver bullet. It doesn't just magically generate maintainable and extensible apps. You might get lucky with a small app and write it from scratch elegantly and efficiently, using each of AngularJS' features correctly, and maybe you even have 100% unit test coverage. Your app might do one thing, and do it flawlessly.
> There are steps you can take to improve your application and get it back in shape for easy development. That means quicker bug fixes, less bugs, and the faster implementation of new features. Taking some time to knock these out will save you from experiencing a lot of pain down the road.

He outlines 13 steps that you can follow to modularise your application.  Some might seem obvious, like putting assets in the right directories, but it's surprising how often people dump files all over the place.  This guide might help you if you've created your first AngularJS project and want to make it tidier.

###codefront.io

[codefront.io](http://codefront.io/) is a conference taking place in Austria on May 10, 2014.  Tickets start at €75 for students, and go up to €150 for tickets that include food and access to the after party.

24 speakers have been listed so far, including Monica Dinculescu from Google, Andy Hume from Twitter, Vitaly Friedman from Smashing Magazine, and Kevin Sawicki from GitHub.  I also noticed Lena Reinhard, who is a core member of [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/), which is a cool open source project you should check out if you haven't seen it before.

The organisers sent me a discount code, so if you buy tickets with [DAILYJS](https://codefront2014.eventbrite.com/?discount=DAILYJS) you may be able to get €10 off your entry fee!
