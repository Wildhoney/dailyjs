###Creating Read-Only References

I was working on an API where the desktop developers were worried I could break their code if my server had a typo in one of the API responses.  The server was returning JSON objects, and some of the properties were important, so if they were spelled incorrectly it could be dangerous.

I wrote unit tests to ensure the API responses were the ones they expected, and used `Object.defineProperty` to make the API response properties read only.  But what if you wanted some objects to have read/write access to an object, and others to be set as read only?

Sergey Bolshchikov sent in his post about this topic, called [Creating Read-Only References](http://blog.bolshchikov.net/post/70680524646/creating-read-only-reference-to-object-in-javascript).  He suggests using `Object.observe`, so certain objets can subscribe to changes.

`Object.observe` is basically the future [standard way to do databinding](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:observe).  Sergey mentions some polyfills for it, so you can use it in browsers.

###Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node

Simon Holmes is writing a book about [Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node](http://www.manning.com/sholmes/).  I've used exactly this cocktail of technologies for some of my commercial work over the last two years, but I'd never thought of the acronym MEAN before.  The marketing spin is it's the new LAMP.

You can download the first chapter free, but the book is currently being written.  If you buy it early you can contribute to its development by providing the author with feedback.  The publisher calls this process [MEAP](http://www.manning.com/about/meap.html#meapfaq) (Manning Early Access Program).
