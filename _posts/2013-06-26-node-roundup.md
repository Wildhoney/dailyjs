###bower-registry

If you're looking to set up your own [Bower](http://bower.io/) registry, then take a look at bower-registry (GitHub: [neoziro / bower-registry](https://github.com/neoziro/bower-registry), License: _MIT_, npm: [bower-registry](https://npmjs.org/package/bower-registry)) by Greg BergÃ©.  This is an Express web application that stores data in Redis, but the author notes it could be easily adapted to support other databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

Running `bower-registry -d redis` on the command-line will start a server.  Other options can be viewed by typing `bower-registry -h`.  The app can also be loaded as a Node module, and `require('bower-registry').Registry` is the Express app instance.

###Helmsman

Helmsman (GitHub: [mattmcmanus / node-helmsman](https://github.com/mattmcmanus/node-helmsman), License: _MIT_, npm: [helmsman](https://npmjs.org/package/helmsman)) by Matt McManus is an opinionated command-line application development kit.  The interface style is based on Git's subcommands:

> A common setup for command line applications is `<command> <subcommand> <arguments/options>` (for example: `git commit -m 'message'`). Rather than having a giant file that `switch`es or `if else`s over each potential subcommand, it's much neater to store each subcommand in it's own file (`bin/command`,`bin/command-subcomand`, `bin/command-subcommand2`, etc). Doing this however introduces some annoying manual steps which `helmsman` hopes to solve.

The subcommand-style API is based on metadata exposed through `exports`.  If the file is run directly rather than loaded with `require`, then your script should run as it would normally:

{% highlight javascript %}
#!/usr/bin/env node

// 1. To expose the metadata simply `exports.command`
exports.command = {
  description: 'Show current worker counts and their pids'
};

// 2. Then make sure it only runs when it's directly called:
if (require.main === module) {
  // Parse options and run the magic
}
{% endhighlight %}
