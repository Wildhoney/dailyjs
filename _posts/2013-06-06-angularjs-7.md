This week we're going to look at form validation with AngularJS.  Angular has several directives that support form field validation, and they're based on the [HTML5 form validators](http://diveintohtml5.info/forms.html).  You can specify that a field is _required_, a certain size, a certain type, and should match a given pattern.

###URL Validation

This tutorial series is about a feed reader, so it's lucky that one of the standard HTML5 validators is for checking URLs.  It can be used by adding the `type="url"` attribute to an `input`.  Angular supports this through the [input url directive](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:input.url).  It takes various options, of which we're interested in `required` and `ng-model`.

The `ng-model` directive allows the `input` to be linked to a model, but any Angular expression can be used.  The [form directive](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:form) allows forms to be managed with Angular, and bound to controllers.

Just by adding a `form` and an `input` with `type="url"` will result in some basic validation support (in `app/views/main.html`):

{% highlight html %}
<form name="newFeed">
  URL: <input size="80" name="url" ng-model="newFeed.url" type="url" required>
  <button ng-click="addFeed(newFeed)">Add Feed</button>
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

However, this won't quite work with the controller code that I wrote in the previous parts because `addFeed` isn't set up to check validation.

###Checking Validation State

In a controller, a bound value can be interrogated for the validation status by checking the `$valid` property.  The previous `addFeed`, in `app/scripts/controllers/main.js`, can be changed as follows:

{% highlight javascript %}
$scope.addFeed = function(feed) {
  if (feed.$valid) {
    // Copy this feed instance and reset the URL in the form
    $scope.feeds.push(feed);
    $scope.newFeed.url = {};
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

This should work, but it does one thing wrong: `$scope.newFeed.url` can't be reset by assigning it to an object literal, because `newFeed` is now decorated with internal properties to support validation.  Instead, _copy_ the new object, and reset the values in `newFeed`:

{% highlight javascript %}
$scope.addFeed = function(feed) {
  if (feed.$valid) {
    // Copy this feed instance and reset the URL in the form
    var newFeed = angular.copy(feed);
    $scope.feeds.push(newFeed);
    $scope.fetchFeed(newFeed);
    $scope.newFeed.url = '';
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

###Fighting with HTML5

We should probably add error messages that are cross-browser compatible.  To do that, you can use the `ng-show` directive:

{% highlight html %}
<form name="newFeed" novalidate>
  URL: <input size="80" name="url" ng-model="newFeed.url" type="url" required>
  <button ng-click="addFeed(newFeed)">Add Feed</button>
  <span class="error" ng-show="newFeed.$error.required">Required!</span>
  <span class="error" ng-show="newFeed.$error.url">Invalid URL format!</span>
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

The [ngShow](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngShow() directive can conditionally show part of the DOM based on an Angular expression -- in this case the validation results are checked.  Incidentally, validation results can be found in the `$error` property fo the model.

Also notice that I added the `novalidate` attribute to the form; if you don't do this HTML5 validations will still kick in, which causes confusing behaviour.

###Disabling the Button

Another nice touch is to use `ng-disabled` to disable the button when an invalid URL has been entered.  The [ngDisabled](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngDisabled) directive takes an Angular expression, like the previous directives discussed here:

{% highlight html %}
<form name="newFeed" novalidate>
  URL: <input size="80" name="url" ng-model="newFeed.url" type="url" required>
  <button ng-disabled="!newFeed.$valid" ng-click="addFeed(newFeed)">Add Feed</button>
  <span class="error" ng-show="newFeed.$error.required">Required!</span>
  <span class="error" ng-show="newFeed.$error.url">Invalid URL format!</span>
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

The difference here is I've used `!` to negate the expression: `!newFeed.$valid`.  Yes, it's really that easy!

###Conclusion

There's more to expressions than simple model-based truth tests -- you can do pretty much anything short of control flow statements.  For more, see [Angular Developer Guide, Expressions](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression).
