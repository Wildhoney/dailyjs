Recently [npm added back download stats](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/78719826768/download-counts-are-back), which means you can see how many downloads a package has had.  The announcement includes the note that Mikito Takada submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/npm/npm-www/pull/466) for the D3 graphs -- it's things like this that make me glad npm's website is open source.

There's a [public API](https://github.com/npm/download-counts) for the statistics, which is written using [hapi](http://spumko.github.io/).

Paul Vorbach sent in [npm-stat](http://npm-stat.com/) (GitHub: [pvorb / npm-stat.com](https://github.com/pvorb/npm-stat.com), License: _MIT_), which generates another set of views on npm's stats.  It displays downloads per day, week, month, and year, and there are graphs for authors as well.  Pages for _certain authors_ that I won't link to directly naturally take a while to generate, but it's generally fairly responsive.

I'm interested in seeing what people build with npm-www and the stats public API, but so far it seems like they've made a big improvement over the older versions.
