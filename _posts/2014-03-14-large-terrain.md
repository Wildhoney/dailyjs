[Rendering large terrains](http://www.pheelicks.com/2014/03/rendering-large-terrains/) by Felix Palmer is a tutorial that demonstrates how to render terrain with a variable level of detail.  There's a [demo](http://felixpalmer.github.io/lod-terrain/) and the [source is on GitHub](https://github.com/felixpalmer/lod-terrain).  It's built with three.js, and is based on a [paper on level-of-detail distribution](http://www.vertexasylum.com/downloads/cdlod/cdlod_latest.pdf).

> A simple way to do better is to split our plane into tiles of differing sizes, but of constant vertex count. So for example, each tile contains 64Ã—64 vertices, but sometimes these vertices are stretched over an area corresponding to a large distant area, while for nearby areas, the tiles are smaller.

The code uses [GLSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language), but the main [app/ JavaScript code](https://github.com/felixpalmer/lod-terrain/tree/master/js/app) is all neatly organised with RequireJS, so it's surprisingly easy to navigate and understand.  The tutorial blog post also makes some of these difficult ideas more accessible, so I thoroughly recommend checking it out.
