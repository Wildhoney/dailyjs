###Orbit Viewer

![Orbit Viewer](/images/posts/orbitviewer.png)

[Orbit Viewer](http://orbits.wthr.us/) is a [Chrome Experiment](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/orbit-viewer/?f=webgl) by Kevin Gill that helps visualise the orbits of comets and satellites.  You can watch the famous comet Shoemakerâ€“Levy 9, or see the current position of the International Space Station.  It should work with most WebGL capable browsers.

> A sort of "Where are they now" for spacecraft and comets: Check out realtime positions, along with historical and projected flight paths of our solar system's trailblazing spacecraft and comets. All in a zoomable/rotatable 3D interface. Using historical and real-time trajectory information for NASA's JPL Horizons system, and in-browser WebGL and Three.js rendering.

###Earhorn

Earhorn (GitHub: [omphalos / earhorn](https://github.com/omphalos/earhorn), License: _MIT_) by "omphalos" is a library for instrumenting JavaScript.  You pass `earhorn$` a label and a function, and then you can view the function as the values change.

The [mouse example](http://omphalos.github.io/earhorn/index.html#/iframe=examples/mouse.html) shows how this works: the source for a jQuery `mousemove` listener is displayed, and whenever you move the mouse the integer values for the current coordinates will be reflected in real time.

An iframe is used that loads the `earhorn/index.html` page which knows how to display an instrumented version of the function.  Internally, Earhorn uses [Esprima](http://esprima.org/) to generate an abstract syntax tree that is manipulated to allow the code to be observed.

It reminds me a little bit of the [Watches feature in Light Table](http://www.chris-granger.com/2013/08/22/light-table-050/), and some of the recent improvements to WebKit Inspector.
