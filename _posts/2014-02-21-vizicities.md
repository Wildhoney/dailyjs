###ViziCities

![ViziCities](/images/posts/vizicities.png)

[ViziCities](http://vizicities.com/) ([Demo](http://vizicities.apps.rawk.es/), GitHub: [robhawkes / vizicities](https://github.com/robhawkes/vizicities), License: _MIT_) by Robin Hawkes and Peter Smart is a WebGL 3D city and data visualisation platform.  It uses [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), and aims to overlay animated data views with 3D city layouts.

The developers have created some visualisations of [social data](http://vimeo.com/67872925), [traffic simulation](http://vimeo.com/66512057), and [public transport](http://vimeo.com/67869313).

It uses Three.js, D3, Grunt, and some stalwarts like Moment.js and Underscore.js.

###Flappy Bird in HTML5 with Phaser

Thomas Palef, who has been making one HTML5 game per-week, has created a tutorial for [making Flappy Bird in HTML5 and Phaser](http://blog.lessmilk.com/how-to-make-flappy-bird-in-html5-1/).  The cool thing about the tutorial is he reduces Flappy Bird to its basic parts -- collision detection, scoring, and the player controls.  Instead of worrying about whether or not the graphics are stolen from Mario, you can just follow along and learn how a game like this works.
