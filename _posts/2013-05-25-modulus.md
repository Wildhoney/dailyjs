![Modulus](/images/posts/modulus.png)

[Modulus.io](https://modulus.io/) is a new hosting platform dedicated to Node.  Why "platform"?  Well, Modulus provides a complete stack for web application development: MongoDB is used for the database and file storage, and WebSockets are supported out of the box.  Applications running on the Modulus stack get metrics -- requests are logged and analysed in real-time.  Horizontal scaling is supported by running multiple instances of your application.

Pricing is determined by the number of instances (servos) that you run, and storage used.  The [Modulus pricing page](https://modulus.io/pricing) has some sliders, allowing you to see how much it'll cost to run your application per-month.

I asked Modulus about using different versions of Node Node, as Heroku supports 0.4 to 0.10.  However, at the time of writing only Node 0.8.15 is supported.  Ghuffran Ali from Modulus said that they're working on supporting multiple Node versions as soon as Monday (27th May), so [keep an eye on the Modulus blog](http://blog.modulus.io/) for details on that.

It's easy to get started with Modulus -- there's a sample project, plus you can sign in with GitHub so it doesn't take too much effort to get a basic application running.  They're also offering $15 free credit, so you could run something more substantial there to see how everything works.

Modulus uses a web-based interface for managing projects that allows various settings to be changed, like environmental variables, and a global SSL redirect.  There's also a command-line client -- if you sign in with GitHub make sure you use `modulus login` with `-g` so you can sign in with your GitHub account.

On a related note, [IrisCouch has joined Nodejitsu](http://blog.nodejitsu.com/iriscouch-acquisition).  That means CouchDB and Redis are now both supported by Nodejitsu:

> This means that our users will be able to deploy their applications and databases from the same set of tools all backed by node.js. If youâ€™re an existing IrisCouch user you will be notified and given ample time to migrate your IrisCouch account into a Nodejitsu account.

It's impressive to see so much innovation in the Node hosting/PaaS space!
