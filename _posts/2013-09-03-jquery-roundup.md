###Recurrence Widget

Dealing with recurring dates isn't easy, but one way of adding a layer of structure to projects that must deal with them intelligently is by following standards like [iCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar).  Johannes Raggam sent in jquery.recurrenceinput.js (GitHub: [collective / jquery.recurrenceinput.js](https://github.com/collective/jquery.recurrenceinput.js), License: _MIT_), which is a UI widget that is compatible with RFC5545.

The widget allows various repeat rules to be selected and then outputs a string that should be usable in ICS files.

###HeapBox

[HeapBox](http://www.bartos.me/heapbox/) (GitHub: [FilipBartos / heapbox](https://github.com/FilipBartos/heapbox), License: _MIT_) by Filip Barto≈° is a `select` replacement.  It has an event-based API, supports standard features like disabling the control, and has some [nice flat UI themes](http://flatuicolors.com/).
