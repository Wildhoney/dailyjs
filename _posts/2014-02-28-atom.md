"Alex, you love talking about text editors, why don't you write about that GitHub Atom project?"

Ah, text editors.  Arguably our most important tools, yet we're more fickle about them than our choice of programming language, web framework, and preferred caffeinated beverage.  [Atom](http://atom.io/) is made by GitHub.  It's built using [dozens of related open source projects](https://github.com/atom), and some of these include "packages" that extend the editor.

All of the packages seem to be written with  CoffeeScript, but before you get your pitchforks out, [take a look at this thread](http://discuss.atom.io/t/why-coffeescript/131):

> You can use plain JS to develop packages.

Phew.  The reason I wanted to write about Atom on DailyJS was it's built using Node and a web view.  The fact it embraces Node means it should be easier for **us** to extend it.  It also claims to have TextMate support, and can use native extensions through Node C and C++ modules.

Parts of Atom are native as well, so it should feel desktop-like rather than web-based:

> Atom is a desktop application based on web technologies. Like other desktop apps, it has its own icon in the dock, native menus and dialogs, and full access to the file system.

I've seen a few generations of desktop text editors come and go: BBEdit, TextMate, and Sublime Text.  I expect the excitement around Atom to follow a similar pattern.  I'm going to write about interesting Atom packages if I think they're of interest to DailyJS readers (please send them in), but you'll still find me happily plodding on with Vim.  And vin (rouge), but that's another story.
